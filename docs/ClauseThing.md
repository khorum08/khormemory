# ClauseScript: An Architectural Textbook on the Clausewitz Scripting Language

**A precise, engineering-oriented reference on the syntax, semantics, data model, and transformation patterns of the scripting language used by Paradox Interactive's grand strategy titles.**

This document provides a formal treatment of ClauseScript (the informal name for the Clausewitz scripting language) suitable for the design and implementation of parsers, interpreters, compilers, and transpilers. It focuses on the language's actual observed behavior across multiple titles and versions, the structures it produces, and the engineering considerations required to correctly ingest, analyze, transform, and execute it.

---

## 1. Introduction: What is ClauseScript?

ClauseScript is a proprietary, domain-specific language developed and evolved by Paradox Development Studio since the early 2000s. It serves as the primary mechanism for defining game entities, rules, behaviors, economies, and narrative content across their grand strategy games.

### Core Design Characteristics

ClauseScript was not designed as a general-purpose programming language. Its defining traits are:

- **Extremely high authoring density** — Human designers must be able to express large amounts of structured data and logic with minimal syntactic overhead.
- **Deliberate ambiguity between data and code** — The same syntactic forms are used for static configuration, dynamic conditions, and state-mutating operations.
- **Heavy reliance on duplication and override semantics** — The language itself does not enforce uniqueness of keys. Correct merging, overriding, and collection behavior is always defined by the consuming system.
- **Implicit context and scoping** — Most operations are relative to an implicit current object. Navigation between objects is a first-class language feature.
- **Long-term evolutionary compatibility** — The language has accreted features over more than two decades. New syntactic and semantic forms have been added while preserving the ability to load older content.

At the semantic level, ClauseScript is a **declarative definition language with embedded imperative effects and a sophisticated scoping and parameterization system**. Its primary output is *definitions* (templates and types), not direct executable commands. A separate ingestion and hydration layer is always required to turn these definitions into runtime participants.

### 1.1 Primary Canonical Reference Sources

This document is derived from direct examination of real Clausewitz content. For any section, the following materials constitute the authoritative, version-specific ground truth. Anyone building a parser, transpiler, or interpreter should treat these as the primary references rather than secondary summaries.

**Organized snapshot (recommended starting point)**
- `Clauser/Paradox/01_Modding_Main.md` — Broad hub page. Game folder layout, modding rules, high-level scripting concepts, and links to all other wiki pages.
- `Clauser/Paradox/02_Dynamic_Modding_Scripting_Format.md` — The single most important document for advanced scripting mechanics (inline scripts, parameters `[[ ]]`, `$PARAM$`, script values, scripted effects/triggers, conditional blocks). Covers the modern "meta" layer of the language.
- `Clauser/Paradox/03_Effects_List.md` — Snapshot of the official Effects wiki page. Useful overview but incomplete compared to generated logs.
- `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/` (fresh as of game load on 2026-05-29):
  - `effects.log` — Complete, version-accurate list of every built-in effect with scope rules and parameter documentation.
  - `triggers.log` — Complete list of every built-in trigger/condition.
  - `modifiers.log` (largest, ~3.8 MB) — Exhaustive list of *all* modifiers the game knows about, including the thousands of dynamically generated ones from economic categories (`planet_miners_minerals_produces_mult`, etc.).
  - `scopes.log` — Definitive list of every valid scope change, with "Supported Scopes" and "Output Scope" metadata.
  - `localizations.log` — Localization key patterns and scripted localization behavior.

**How to obtain fresh, authoritative logs for your exact game version**
Launch Stellaris (any save or new game is sufficient). The game writes the complete current documentation into:
`Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\logs\script_documentation\`
Copy the five files above into your reference folder. These are always more accurate and complete than the wiki snapshots for the running version.

**Live game script (highest fidelity source)**
The actual `common/` tree inside the Stellaris installation directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\...`) is the real definition of the language's usage. Especially valuable:
- `common/economic_categories/` (including `99_README_ECONOMIC_CATEGORIES.txt`)
- `common/ai_budget/` (including `documentation.txt`)
- `common/deposits/`, `common/pop_jobs/`, `common/buildings/`, `common/districts/`
- `common/inline_scripts/` (especially `jobs/` and `output/`)
- `common/scripted_effects/`, `common/scripted_triggers/`, `common/script_values/`
- `common/scripted_variables/`
- Any folder's `00_DOCUMENTATION.txt` or `README*.txt` files

Many sections below contain specific file pointers that expand on the general corpus above.

## 2. The Core Syntax and Lexical Model

### 2.1 Lexical Elements

The language is defined over a small set of terminal tokens:

- **Unquoted scalars**: Sequences of characters that do not contain whitespace or the characters `{}[]=#"`. These are the most common form of identifiers, numbers, and enum-like values.
- **Quoted scalars**: Strings delimited by `"`. Support for escape sequences is limited and implementation-dependent.
- **Operators**: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`. The `=` token is heavily overloaded.
- **Braces**: `{` and `}` (universal container delimiters).
- **Square brackets**: `[` and `]` (used less frequently, primarily for arrays or special parameter syntax).
- **Comments**: Lines beginning with `#`.

Date literals (e.g., `1444.11.11`) and certain numeric forms are treated as special cases of scalars by higher layers.

### 2.2 The Block as the Fundamental Structural Unit

The `{ ... }` construct is the only recursive structural element in the language. All complex data and logic exist inside blocks.

A block has no intrinsic type. Its interpretation depends entirely on context and content. There are three primary roles:

#### Role 1: Object (Keyed Map)

The most common role. The block contains zero or more `key operator value` pairs.

```script
country = {
    tag = "ENG"
    graphical_culture = westerngfx
    color = { 200 16 46 }
}
```

Keys may be duplicated. The language itself does not define whether duplicate keys represent a set, a last-wins map, an ordered list, or something else. This is a semantic decision made by the consuming system.

#### Role 2: Array (Positional List)

The block contains zero or more bare values with no keys.

```script
traits = { brave just ambitious }
```

#### Role 3: Mixed Container

A block that begins as an array but later contains keyed entries (or vice versa). This is one of the most distinctive and difficult features of the language.

```script
allowed_buildings = {
    "castle"
    "market"
    special_building = yes
    "university"
}
```

Mixed containers require parsers to track state transitions and are a major source of complexity in robust implementations.

### 2.3 Headers

A header is a scalar immediately followed by a block, without an intervening operator:

```script
color = rgb { 100 150 200 }
```

Headers are used to attach type or semantic information to a block. Common examples include `rgb`, `hsv`, `list`, and various game-specific forms.

### 2.4 Operators

The language recognizes a small set of infix operators, almost always appearing between a key and a value:

- `=` — The default and most common operator. Semantically overloaded.
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==` — Comparison operators.

The presence of a non-`=` operator on a key-value pair is significant and must be preserved by any faithful representation.

### 2.5 Parameter and Conditional Syntax (`[[ ... ]]`)

ClauseScript supports a limited but powerful form of conditional inclusion and parameterization using double square brackets:

```script
[[scaled_skill]
    add_skill = scope:skill_value
]
[[!scaled_skill]
    add_skill = 2
]
```

- `[[param]` — Include the enclosed content only if `param` is provided and truthy.
- `[[!param]` — Include the enclosed content only if `param` is absent or falsy.
- `$PARAM$` — Textual substitution of a parameter value.
- `@\[ ... ]` — Inline arithmetic expressions (added in later versions).

This syntax operates at the textual/structural level during parsing or early transformation, not as runtime evaluation.

### 2.6 Duplication Semantics

Key duplication is not an error condition in ClauseScript. The language deliberately leaves the meaning of repeated keys undefined at the syntactic level.

Common observed patterns across titles include:

- **Last-wins**: Later definitions replace earlier ones for the same key.
- **Collection**: All values for a duplicated key are gathered into a list (ordered or unordered).
- **Override with inheritance**: Later definitions modify or extend earlier ones according to game-specific rules.

Any correct transpiler or interpreter must treat the *ordered sequence* of key occurrences as semantically significant until a higher-level policy is applied.

### 2.7 Edge Cases, Weeds, and Deep Syntax

The happy-path syntax described above is only the beginning. Production Clausewitz content (especially saves and certain game files) routinely exercises far more exotic forms. Robust parsers and transpilers must be **liberal in what they accept** while remaining conservative and faithful in what they emit. The following patterns have been observed across multiple titles and are drawn from extensive community reverse-engineering.

#### Boundary Characters and Extreme Condensation
Almost any boundary character (whitespace, `{`, `}`, operators, `"`, or `#`) can separate multiple key-value or bare-value pairs on a single line. This enables highly condensed (and still valid) documents:

```script
a={b="1"c=d}foo=bar#good
```

is exactly equivalent to the nicely formatted block form with the comment. Parsers that assume one logical statement per line or require whitespace will fail here.

#### Externally Tagged / Headered Containers (Expanded)
Headers are not limited to simple color forms. The engine uses them for typed collections and other semantic wrappers:

```script
color = rgb { 100 200 150 }
color = hsv { 0.43 0.86 0.61 }
color = hsv360 { 25 75 63 }
color = hex { aabbccdd }
mild_winter = LIST { 3700 3701 }
```

The header scalar (`rgb`, `hsv`, `LIST`, etc.) is part of the value and must be preserved by any faithful representation or round-tripping writer.

#### Quoted Scalar Rules (Full Detail)
Quoted strings are the most treacherous scalar form:
- May contain literal newlines.
- Support limited escapes: `\"` and `\\`.
- Can embed game-specific escape codes (Imperator uses `<0x15>` sequences that are translated into `#` or other markup during parsing).
- Encoding is game-dependent: Windows-1252 for many older titles (EU4), UTF-8 for newer ones (CK3+). A UTF-8 BOM may appear on the file.
- Quoted and unquoted forms of the "same" scalar are **not** always interchangeable. EU4 is known to corrupt saves when certain fields (classically `unit_type`) receive a quoted value that the engine only accepts unquoted.

Example of complex escapes and color codes:

```script
ooo="hello
     world"
nnn="ab <0x15>D ( ID: 691 )<0x15>!"
```

#### Parameter Syntax in Practice
Beyond the basic `[[param] ... [[!param] ... ]]` form, the syntax (introduced in EU4 Dharma) supports textual substitution of provided parameters with `$PARAM$` inside the conditional block. It is a purely textual/structural expansion pass performed before normal interpretation.

#### Mixed Containers and Trailers (EU4 vs CK3 Idioms)
- EU4 "array trailers": an object begins with normal keyed content then switches to bare positional values (or vice versa).
- CK3 "hidden objects": an array of bare values is followed by keyed pairs that logically belong to a trailing sub-object.

```script
brittany_area = {
    color = { 118 99 151 }
    169 170 171 172 4384
}

levels = { 10 0=2 1=2 }

```

Parsers must track state transitions inside a single block and cannot assume a block is purely an object or purely an array once it has begun.

#### Empty and Ghost Constructs
- `{}` is ambiguous (empty object vs empty array) and must be resolved by context or left to the caller.
- Multiple consecutive empty blocks are common and must be tolerated (and usually skipped for most analyses): `history = { {} {} 1629.11.10 = { core = AAA } }`.
- Ghost objects (bare `{}` inside object contexts) act as structural separators in some save data.

#### Scalar and Key Oddities
- Keys and scalars can be dates, negative numbers, or even other scalars: `-1 = aaa`, `"1821.1.1" = bbb`.
- Non-alphanumeric characters are common: `flavor_tur.8 = yes`, `dashed-identifier = yes`, `province_id = event_target:agenda_province`.
- Victoria II saves contain unquoted keys with Windows-1252 non-ASCII characters (e.g., `jean_jaurès = { }`).
- The empty string is only representable as a quoted scalar: `name = ""`. A bare `=` is a valid (if bizarre) key.
- Very large integers must not be naively stored as f64; values such as `18446744073709547616` lose precision when forced through floating point.

#### Interpolation and Variables
Inline expressions of the form `@[1-leo_x]` appear in position and scaling calculations. These are distinct from the `[[ ]]` parameter mechanism and are evaluated at a different layer.

#### Structural Leniency and Damage
- Extraneous closing braces appear in Victoria II saves, certain CK2 saves, and some EU4 game files (e.g., `verona.txt`). The parser must tolerate and usually ignore them.
- Missing closing braces are also observed: `a = { b=c` (without the final `}`) can be valid in context.
- Semicolons after quoted values (or occasionally lines) are ignored: `textureFile3 = "gfx//mapitems//trade_terrain.dds";`.
- First lines of save files are special markers and must be stripped before normal parsing (`EU4txt`, `SAV0102...`, etc.). They are not part of the ClauseScript grammar proper.

#### Infinite Nesting and Scale
Objects can be nested arbitrarily deep (modded recursive events reaching hundreds of levels have been observed). Combined with save files exceeding 100 MB and seven million lines, this demands streaming or tape-based representations rather than naive recursive descent that builds a full tree in memory.

#### The "Deep End" (Isolated Contradictions)
Some constructs appear only in specific files or titles and contradict the patterns elsewhere:
- Unmarked lists (no braces) in CK3 and Imperator: `pattern = list "christian_emblems_list"`.
- Alternating bare values and key-value pairs inside the same block (common in `on_actions`).
- Values that are syntactically present but must be semantically skipped by consumers (e.g., stray bare `definition` tokens before the real keyed definition).

Because the engine is closed-source and each game object can effectively invent syntax, no parser can ever be proven complete. The only reliable strategy is continuous exposure to real content (especially saves from many versions and heavy mods) plus liberal acceptance.

#### Parser Implementation Lessons from Production Tools
High-performance, robust implementations favor:
- **Tape / flat token representations** with end-pointers (enabling O(1) subtree navigation and skipping of huge irrelevant sections without allocation).
- Pull/streaming readers for memory-bounded processing of GB-scale saves.
- Delayed scalar typing (a token may be a date, integer, or string depending on the consuming schema and game version).
- Explicit preservation of quoting, operator choice, and original token order (critical for round-tripping and for games that treat quoted vs unquoted differently).

- Live game files: any `common/` folder with heavy use of mixed containers or duplicated keys (e.g., `common/on_actions/`, `common/traditions/`, `common/events/`).
- High-performance tape-based and streaming Clausewitz parsers (and their extensive test corpora and roundtrip fixtures) demonstrate the `TextTape` / `TokenReader` model and the necessity of handling the edge cases above at scale.

## 3. The Meta-Scripting Layer

While the core syntax described in the previous section is sufficient to write functional Clausewitz content, virtually all modern, maintainable, and high-fidelity content relies on a powerful *meta-scripting layer*. This layer exists above the raw syntax and provides reusability, parameterization, dynamic calculation, and modular composition.

Understanding this layer is essential for any serious parser, transpiler, or interpreter. These features are not merely "convenience syntax"—they fundamentally change the authoring model and impose specific requirements on how content must be processed.

### 3.1 Why the Meta-Scripting Layer Exists

While the core syntax described in the previous section is sufficient to write functional Clausewitz content, virtually all modern, maintainable, and high-fidelity content relies on a powerful *meta-scripting layer*. This layer exists above the raw syntax and provides reusability, parameterization, dynamic calculation, and modular composition.

Understanding this layer is essential for any serious parser, transpiler, or interpreter. These features are not merely "convenience syntax"—they fundamentally change the authoring model and impose specific requirements on how content must be processed.

The key constructs are:

- Scripted Effects and Scripted Triggers
- Parameterization (`$PARAM$`)
- Conditional Inclusion (`[[PARAM]]` / `[[!PARAM]]`)
- Inline Scripts
- Script Values (`value:` references)
- Scripted Localization
- Dynamic variables and flags using `@`

These features operate primarily at **expansion time** (before or during the early stages of the hydration pipeline), not at runtime.

### 3.2 Scripted Effects and Scripted Triggers

Scripted effects (`common/scripted_effects/`) and scripted triggers (`common/scripted_triggers/`) are the most basic form of reusability. They allow a block of logic to be defined once and invoked by name.

```script
# common/scripted_effects/plague_effects.txt
apply_planetary_plague = {
    $SEVERITY$ = 1
    $TARGET_POP$ = any
    $DURATION$ = 360

    hidden_effect = {
        planet_event = { id = plague.1 days = $DURATION$ }
    }

    every_owned_pop = {
        limit = { $TARGET_POP$ }
        add_modifier = {
            modifier = plague_mortality
            days = $DURATION$
            multiplier = $SEVERITY$
        }
    }
}
```

Usage:
```script
apply_planetary_plague = {
    SEVERITY = 2.5
    TARGET_POP = is_enslaved
    DURATION = 180
}
```

**Engineering considerations:**
- Parameter substitution is textual/structural, not semantic.
- Parameters are substituted before most other processing (including scope resolution in many contexts).
- Duplicate definitions across files follow the normal duplication rules of the consuming system.
- Scripted effects can call other scripted effects (with care around recursion and expansion order).

### 3.3 Parameters and Conditional Inclusion

The parameterization system is more sophisticated than simple string replacement.

#### Basic Parameter Substitution
`$PARAM$` is replaced with the value passed at the call site.

#### Conditional Inclusion
```script
[[SEVERITY]
    multiplier = $SEVERITY$
]
[[!SEVERITY]
    multiplier = 1.0
]
```

- `[[PARAM]` includes the block only if `PARAM` is provided and has a truthy value.
- `[[!PARAM]` includes the block only if `PARAM` is absent or falsy.

This syntax can nest and can contain other meta features.

#### Parameter Conditions with Logic
Later versions support more complex conditional forms inside the brackets.

**Critical implementation detail:** These conditions are evaluated during the *expansion* phase, before the full scope and symbol resolution that happens later in the pipeline. A parser or transpiler must perform parameter substitution and conditional inclusion as an early, separate pass (or as the first major stage of a multi-pass expansion process).

### 3.4 Inline Scripts

`inline_script` (introduced around Stellaris 3.5 / equivalent patches in other titles) is one of the most powerful modern meta features.

```script
inline_script = "output/foundry_output"
```

Or with parameters:
```script
inline_script = {
    script = "plague/mortality_calculation"
    SEVERITY = 1.8
    PLANET_TYPE = $PLANET_CLASS$
}
```

**Key engineering properties:**
- The target file is resolved relative to `common/inline_scripts/`.
- Full parameter support (including nested `[[ ]]` blocks inside the included script).
- The included content is effectively inlined at the call site before further processing.
- This is *not* a runtime call — it is a structural inclusion.
- Because inclusion happens early, the resulting structure must still obey all normal duplication and scope rules.

Inline scripts are heavily used in vanilla for economic output tables, job weights, and complex modifier blocks precisely because they allow massive reduction in duplication while remaining within the existing declarative model.

### 3.5 Script Values (`value:` references)

Script values (`common/script_values/`) provide a dedicated system for complex, reusable numeric calculations.

```script
value:plague_mortality_rate = {
    base = 0.01
    modifier = {
        factor = 2
        is_enslaved = yes
    }
    complex_trigger_modifier = {
        trigger = has_trait
        parameters = { trait = trait_robust }
        mode = add
        value = -0.005
    }
}
```

Usage:
```script
every_owned_pop = {
    limit = { is_enslaved = yes }
    change_variable = {
        which = plague_deaths
        value = value:plague_mortality_rate
    }
}
```

**Important distinctions:**
- Script values are distinct from scripted variables (`@variable`).
- They support `complex_trigger_modifier`, which is the primary way to extract numeric information from triggers that would otherwise only return booleans.
- They can be parameterized in modern versions.
- Evaluation order and caching behavior are implementation-defined by the game and must be respected by any simulator or transpiler that wants high fidelity.

### 3.6 Scripted Localization and Dynamic Flags

Two smaller but important features complete the meta layer:

- **Scripted localization** (`defined_text` blocks) allows dynamic text generation based on triggers and parameters.
- **Dynamic flags and variables** using the `@scope` syntax (e.g., `set_flag = @root`) allow names to be constructed dynamically.

These features are frequently used together with the other meta constructs.

### 3.7 Expansion Order and Semantics (Critical for Implementers)

The meta-scripting features do not all expand at the same time or in the same pass. A correct implementation must understand the rough ordering:

1. Scripted variables (`@variable`) — early, mostly textual.
2. `inline_script` inclusion + parameter substitution + `[[ ]]` conditional blocks.
3. Script value references (`value:`) — evaluated when the containing effect/trigger is processed.
4. Runtime variables and dynamic flags — evaluated during actual execution.

**Common pitfalls for transpilers:**
- Attempting to resolve scopes before parameter and inline script expansion.
- Treating `value:` references as simple constants.
- Not preserving the *ordered* nature of included content when performing duplication resolution.
- Assuming that an `inline_script` with parameters can be naively inlined without re-running the full parameter expansion logic on the included content.

### 3.8 Worked Example: A Parameterized Planetary Plague System

We will build a reusable plague system using the meta-scripting features. This example is designed to be consistent with the food production and economic examples used elsewhere in this document.

#### Step 1: Define a Script Value for Mortality

```script
# common/script_values/plague_values.txt
value:plague_mortality = {
    base = 0.015
    modifier = {
        factor = 1.5
        has_strata = slave
    }
    modifier = {
        factor = 0.6
        has_technology = tech_genetic_resilience
    }
    complex_trigger_modifier = {
        trigger = has_building
        parameters = { building = building_hospital }
        mode = multiply
        value = 0.7
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Parameterized Scripted Effect

```script
# common/scripted_effects/plague_effects.txt
apply_planetary_plague = {
    $SEVERITY$ = 1.0
    $DURATION$ = 360
    $TARGET_STATA$ = any

    # Apply mortality
    every_owned_pop = {
        limit = { $TARGET_STATA$ }
        change_variable = {
            which = current_plague_deaths
            value = value:plague_mortality
        }
        multiply = $SEVERITY$
    }

    # Apply production penalty via inline script
    inline_script = {
        script = "plague/production_penalty"
        SEVERITY = $SEVERITY$
        DURATION = $DURATION$
    }

    # Schedule recovery
    planet_event = { id = plague.100 days = $DURATION$ }
}
```

#### Step 3: Use Inline Script for Complex Penalty Logic

```script
# common/inline_scripts/plague/production_penalty.txt
every_owned_pop = {
    limit = { strata = worker }
    add_modifier = {
        modifier = plague_food_output_penalty
        days = $DURATION$
        multiplier = $SEVERITY$
    }
}
```

#### Usage Example (from an event)

```script
country_event = {
    id = plague.1
    ...
    option = {
        name = "Quarantine the sector"
        capital_scope = {
            apply_planetary_plague = {
                SEVERITY = 1.8
                DURATION = 240
                TARGET_STATA = is_enslaved
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This single example demonstrates parameterization, conditional logic, script values with `complex_trigger_modifier`, and inline scripts working together in a realistic, maintainable way.

### 3.9 Transpiler and Interpreter Implications

Any system that wishes to consume real Clausewitz content at high fidelity must treat the meta-scripting layer as a first-class concern:

- Perform a dedicated expansion pass (or passes) before full semantic analysis.
- Preserve enough information during expansion to support later debugging, error reporting, and mod compatibility tools.
- Understand that many "effects" a designer writes are actually *templates* that only become concrete after expansion.
- Be prepared to handle recursive or deeply nested meta usage (especially with inline scripts calling other inline scripts).

Failing to properly model this layer is one of the most common sources of fidelity loss when building tools for Clausewitz games.

## 4. Scopes and Context

### 4.1 Fundamental Model

Every trigger and every effect in ClauseScript is evaluated relative to a **current scope**. The scope is the implicit "this" object for the current statement.

Scope changes are explicit operations that replace the current context:

```script
owner = { ... }           # Current scope becomes the owner country
capital_scope = { ... }   # Current scope becomes the capital planet
```

### 4.2 Special Navigation Scopes

Four special scopes exist in every context and are not tied to domain objects:

- **`this`** — The current scope.
- **`root`** — The original root scope of the current evaluation context (typically the primary object an event or effect chain was triggered on).
- **`from`** — The root scope of the previous evaluation context in a chain (commonly used for passing information between events).
- **`prev`** — The scope that was current immediately before the most recent scope change.

These four scopes (and their transitive forms: `fromfrom`, `prevprevprev`, `root.from`, etc.) form a small but extremely important navigation system. They are the primary mechanism for context passing in event-driven and chained script.

### 4.3 Domain Scopes and Supported/Output Rules

Most scope changes are domain-specific (e.g., `owner`, `planet`, `fleet`, `species`, `starbase`, `sector`, `overlord`, etc.).

Each such scope change carries two critical pieces of metadata:

- **Supported Scopes**: The set of scopes from which this change is legal.
- **Output Scope**: The type of scope that results from the change.

A correct implementation must enforce or at least be aware of these constraints, as invalid scope transitions are a major source of runtime errors and subtle bugs in ClauseScript content.

### 4.4 Dot Notation

Scopes may be chained without entering blocks using dot notation:

```script
root.owner.capital_scope.is_same_value = this
```

This is semantically equivalent to nested scope changes but is evaluated as a path expression.

**Further Clarification Sources for This Section**
- `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/scopes.log` — The definitive, version-accurate list of every scope change with Supported Scopes and Output Scope. This is the single best reference for implementing scope validation.
- `Clauser/Paradox/01_Modding_Main.md` — High-level overview of scopes and context in the official documentation.
- `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/effects.log` and `triggers.log` — Every entry explicitly lists the scopes in which the effect/trigger is legal.
- Live game: `common/scripted_triggers/` and `common/scripted_effects/` contain thousands of real-world examples of complex scope chains and `root`/`from`/`prev` navigation.

## 5. Triggers and Conditions

### 5.1 Nature of Triggers

Triggers are expressions that evaluate to a boolean value. They are the only mechanism for conditional execution and filtering in the language.

Triggers are always evaluated in the context of a current scope. A trigger that is meaningful in one scope may be meaningless or always false in another.

### 5.2 Logical Connectives

ClauseScript provides a small but sufficient set of logical operators:

- Implicit `AND` (multiple sibling conditions)
- Explicit `AND`
- `OR`
- `NOT`
- `NAND`
- `NOR`
- `calc_true_if` (counts the number of true conditions among its children)

These operators can be nested arbitrarily.

### 5.3 Built-in vs. Scripted Triggers

The engine provides a large library of primitive triggers (documented in `triggers.log` for each game version). These are the atomic conditions.

Scripted triggers (defined in `common/scripted_triggers/`) are user-defined composite conditions. They may contain parameters and may themselves be used anywhere a built-in trigger is accepted.

### 5.4 Parameters and Metaprogramming

Scripted triggers support the same parameterization and conditional inclusion syntax as scripted effects (`$PARAM$`, `[[param]]`, `@\[ ]`).

This creates a limited but effective metaprogramming facility at the condition level.

### 5.5 Common Usage Patterns

Triggers appear in several structural roles:

- Event `trigger` blocks (preconditions for an event to be eligible)
- `limit = {}` clauses inside iterators and many effects
- `potential` and `allow` blocks on decisions, policies, etc.
- `if` / `else_if` / `else` control flow
- `switch` statements
- `ai_will_do` and weighting expressions

## 6. Effects

### 6.1 Nature of Effects

Effects are statements that mutate game state. They are the imperative component of ClauseScript.

Like triggers, effects are always executed in the context of a current scope. The meaning and validity of an effect is heavily dependent on that scope.

### 6.2 Scripted Effects

Scripted effects (defined in `common/scripted_effects/`) are the primary mechanism for abstraction and reuse of effect sequences. They support parameters, conditional inclusion, and inline math.

### 6.3 Effect Composition and Ordering

The order of statements inside an effect block is generally significant. Many effects have side effects that subsequent statements can observe.

### 6.4 Hidden Effects and Tooltip Control

The `hidden_effect` wrapper and various `custom_tooltip` constructs exist to separate the actual state changes from what is displayed to the player. Any faithful representation must preserve these distinctions.

## 7. The Modifier System

The modifier system is one of the most important and pervasive mechanisms in ClauseScript. Nearly every persistent bonus, penalty, or rule change in the game is ultimately expressed through modifiers.

### 7.1 Core Concepts

A **modifier** is a named key with a numeric value that alters some aspect of game state or behavior. Modifiers are **not** direct effects — they are data that the simulation engine reads when calculating values.

There are two main ways modifiers enter the game:

- **Static modifiers** — Declared directly in a definition (e.g. inside a tradition, building, technology, or edict).
- **Triggered modifiers** — Wrapped in a `triggered_modifier` block that includes a `potential` trigger. The modifier only applies while the potential is true.

Example of both:

```script
# Static
modifier = {
    pop_housing_usage_mult = -0.10
}

# Triggered
triggered_modifier = {
    potential = {
        is_wilderness_empire = yes
    }
    building_time_mult = -0.10
}
```

### 7.2 Modifier Categories and Application Hierarchy

One of the most critical engineering aspects of the modifier system is **categories**.

Every modifier (especially scripted ones) can declare a `category`:

```script
pop_job_amenities_mult = {
    category = planet
    percentage = yes
    good = yes
    ...
}
```

The category determines **at which level** in the simulation hierarchy the modifier is evaluated and applied. Common categories include:

- `country`
- `planet`
- `pop` / `pop_group`
- `ship`
- `fleet`
- `starbase`
- `leader`
- `economic_unit`
- `system`
- `federation`
- `all` (applies broadly)

This hierarchy matters enormously for:
- Stacking order
- When the modifier is recalculated
- Which objects "see" the modifier
- Performance (a country-level modifier is cheaper to evaluate than a per-pop modifier)

A transpiler must model this hierarchy correctly if it wants to replicate economic or military calculations accurately.

### 7.3 Modifier Types and Mathematical Behavior

Modifiers come in different mathematical flavors:

- **Additive** (`_add`): Simple addition (e.g. `country_naval_cap_add = 20`)
- **Multiplicative** (`_mult`): Usually percentage-based (e.g. `pop_housing_usage_mult = -0.10`)
- **Special** forms: Some modifiers have unique stacking or clamping rules defined in the engine.

Important behaviors to capture:
- Many multiplicative modifiers are **additive in their effect** (two `-10%` modifiers usually become `-20%`, not `-19%`).
- Some modifiers are clamped (e.g. `cap_zero_to_one` on scripted modifiers).
- Some are marked as `percentage = yes` purely for tooltip purposes.

### 7.4 Modifier Application and Recalculation

Modifiers are generally not evaluated constantly. The game uses various invalidation and recalculation strategies:

- Some modifiers are recalculated on specific events (building completed, pop created, month tick, etc.).
- Others are cached until a relevant scope changes.
- Triggered modifiers re-evaluate their `potential` when relevant state changes occur.

A high-quality transpiler needs to understand or approximate these recalculation semantics, especially for performance-sensitive calculations (e.g. monthly resource income).

### 7.5 Interaction with the Economy

Modifiers are the primary way ClauseScript influences economic behavior:

- Resource production (`planet_jobs_*_produces_mult`)
- Resource upkeep (`planet_structures_*_upkeep_mult`)
- Construction and research costs
- Job weights and output
- Trade value, amenities, stability, etc.

Because modifiers can be applied at different levels (`country` vs `planet` vs `pop`), the same conceptual bonus can have very different economic consequences depending on where it is applied.

### 7.6 Persistence and Removal

Most modifiers from traditions, civics, origins, and technologies are effectively permanent for the lifetime of the object they are attached to.

Modifiers from edicts, decisions, or temporary events usually have an explicit duration or are removed when a condition is no longer met.

Script must be able to:
- Add modifiers with duration
- Remove specific modifiers
- Check whether an object currently has a given modifier (`has_modifier = xxx`)

### 7.7 Transpiler Implications

For anyone building a transpiler or interpreter:

- **Model modifiers as first-class data**, not just as side effects of other definitions.
- **Preserve category information** — it is semantically load-bearing.
- **Distinguish static vs triggered modifiers** — they have very different evaluation semantics.
- **Understand the application hierarchy** — this directly affects how economic calculations should be structured in the target system.
- **Track modifier sources** — many games allow inspecting "where did this bonus come from?"
- **Handle stacking rules carefully** — they are not always simple addition or multiplication.

The modifier system is one of the primary ways ClauseScript achieves its famous flexibility. Getting the model wrong here usually breaks economy, military, and diplomatic calculations downstream.

## 8. Variables, Script Values, and Expressions

Modern Clausewitz scripting makes heavy use of variables and dynamic value computation. This has evolved from simple `set_variable` usage into a sophisticated expression system.

### 8.1 Scripted Variables

Defined in `common/scripted_variables/`:

```script
@example_unity_cost = 100
```

These are basically compile-time constants that can be referenced with `@example_unity_cost`.

### 8.2 Runtime Variables

Objects (countries, planets, leaders, etc.) can have arbitrary named variables attached to them using:

- `set_variable = { which = my_var value = 50 }`
- `change_variable`, `subtract_variable`, etc.
- `check_variable`, `is_variable_set`

These variables persist with the object (subject to savegame rules) and can be used in triggers and effects.

### 8.3 Script Values (value: references)

Introduced in later versions, **Script Values** allow complex, reusable calculations:

```script
value:example_script_value
```

Defined in `common/script_values/`, these support:
- Base values + mathematical operations
- `modifier = {}` blocks with triggers
- `complex_trigger_modifier` (extract numeric results from triggers that normally only return booleans)
- Recursion and parameterization

This system is extremely powerful for AI weights, costs, and dynamic effects.

### 8.4 Inline Math

The `@\[ ... ]` syntax allows limited arithmetic directly in script:

```script
add_resource = { unity = @[ 100 * $MULTIPLIER$ ] }
```

There are known limitations (only the first `@[]` in a scripted effect may evaluate correctly in some versions).

### 8.5 Transpiler Considerations

- Variables are **late-bound** and scope-dependent.
- Script Values represent a significant increase in expressive power and should be treated as a first-class expression language.
- The boundary between "compile time" (`@` variables) and "runtime" (normal variables and script values) is important for optimization.
- `complex_trigger_modifier` is a particularly interesting escape hatch that lets designers extract numeric values from systems that were never designed to expose numbers.

A good transpiler should probably have a dedicated expression/IR layer for Script Values rather than trying to inline everything.

## 9. On Actions

`On Actions` are one of the most important (and under-appreciated) parts of the Clausewitz scripting model.

### 9.1 What On Actions Are

Defined primarily in `common/on_actions/`, an `on_action` is a named hook that the game engine calls at specific moments in simulation lifetime.

Examples (from Stellaris):

- `on_game_start`
- `on_monthly_pulse`
- `on_yearly_pulse`
- `on_leader_recruited`
- `on_fleet_destroyed_victim`
- `on_building_built`
- `on_pop_enslaved`
- Many, many more

### 9.2 How They Are Used

When an on_action fires, the game executes all registered effects for that hook in the appropriate scope.

This is the primary mechanism for:
- Periodic AI and economy behavior
- Reacting to major game events without every system having to poll
- Mods injecting behavior into core game loops

### 9.3 Engineering Characteristics

- On actions are **fire-and-forget** from the engine's perspective.
- Multiple mods can register effects for the same on_action (they all run).
- Scope when the on_action fires is usually well-defined but can be surprising.
- Some on_actions are extremely high frequency (`on_monthly_pulse` on every planet, for example).
- Performance is a real concern — heavy logic in common on_actions can tank the game.

### 9.4 Transpiler Implications

On Actions represent an **event-driven architecture** layered on top of the more declarative definition systems.

A transpiler needs to:
- Recognize which on_actions are relevant to the target simulation's tick/boundary model.
- Decide how to translate periodic pulses (monthly/yearly) into the target system's time model.
- Handle the fact that many "AI personalities" and economic behaviors are actually implemented as on_action effects rather than pure weight-based decisions.

Ignoring On Actions is one of the fastest ways to produce an incomplete or incorrect model of Clausewitz behavior.

## 10. Resource Production, Dependencies, Governance, and Flow

ClauseScript does not contain an explicit "resource flow graph" or "production method" primitive in the sense of a single dedicated block type that authors wire together. Instead, resource production, consumption, and attribution emerge from the interaction of several interlocking declarative and scoped mechanisms. The resulting system is one of the most sophisticated economy-authoring surfaces in any Clausewitz title and creates an implicit, multi-layered, multi-owner directed graph of production and capture that any faithful transpiler or interpreter must reconstruct.

This section provides a ground-truth treatment based on the actual script structures in a current Stellaris installation (`common/economic_categories/`, `common/deposits/`, `common/pop_jobs/`, `common/buildings/`, `common/districts/`, `common/ai_budget/`, `common/policies/`, `common/inline_scripts/`, the generated `modifiers.log`, and supporting effects/triggers).

### 10.1 The Core Declarative Production Primitive: The `resources` Block

The fundamental unit of ongoing resource movement is the `resources` block (and its sibling `overlord_resources`). It appears inside job definitions, building definitions, district definitions, deposit definitions, megastructures, ships, and other objects that have an economic life.

Typical shape (from `common/pop_jobs/03_worker_jobs.txt`, technician job):

```script
resources = {
    category = planet_technician
    produces = {
        energy = 6
    }
    produces = {
        trigger = {
            exists = owner
            owner = { is_robot_empire = yes }
        }
        energy = 2
    }
    produces = {
        trigger = {
            planet = { has_planet_flag = has_energy_requisitorium }
        }
        energy = @requisitorium_energy_reduction
    }
}

overlord_resources = {
    category = planet_requisitioned_energy
    produces = {
        trigger = {
            planet = { has_planet_flag = has_energy_requisitorium }
        }
        energy = @requisitorium_energy_overlord
    }
}
```

Key properties of the model:

- A single `resources` block can contain multiple `produces`, `upkeep`, and `cost` sub-blocks.
- Each sub-block may carry an optional `trigger` (evaluated in the scope of the object containing the block — usually planet or the job's pop).
- The `category = <economic_category>` tag classifies the entire flow for AI budgeting, modifier generation, and UI grouping.
- `overlord_resources` is a parallel table evaluated only when the object is a subject under certain conditions. It writes into different categories (e.g., `planet_requisitioned_*`) that the overlord later claims.
- Values can be literals, `@scripted_variables`, or later `value:` expressions (see Variables section).

The engine does not execute these blocks as imperative statements. It treats every object instance (every pop on a job, every built building, every orbital deposit station) as a live producer node whose output tables are re-evaluated whenever relevant state changes (pop count, modifier stack, owner, planet flags, etc.).

### 10.2 Raw Generation Sites: Deposits

Deposits (`common/deposits/`) are the primary mechanism for placing non-pop resource production on the map.

Two main patterns exist:

1. **District enablers** (most planetary deposits):
   ```script
   d_arid_highlands = {
       category = deposit_cat_energy
       planet_modifier = {
           district_generator_max_add = 1
       }
       ...
   }
   ```
   These do not produce resources directly. They increase the maximum number of a certain district type that can be built on the planet. The actual production then comes from the jobs those districts provide.

2. **Direct station production** (orbital and some special deposits, `01_orbital_deposits.txt`):
   ```script
   d_minerals_2 = {
       icon = d_mining_station
       resources = {
           category = orbital_mining_deposits
           produces = {
               minerals = 2
           }
       }
       station = shipclass_mining_station
       ...
   }
   ```
   Here the deposit itself is a producer. The `category` routes the minerals into the AI budget and modifier systems under `orbital_mining_deposits`.

Other important deposit concepts:
- `potential` and `drop_weight` control placement during galaxy generation and terraforming swaps.
- `blocked_modifier` and `constant_modifier` apply planet-level effects while the deposit is inaccessible or always.
- `add_deposit` and `add_deposit_category_effect` (documented in `effects.log`) allow events and scripted effects to inject new generation sites dynamically after game start.

Deposits therefore act as the "leaves" or "sources" in any derived resource flow tree: either they directly emit into a category bucket (orbital) or they expand the capacity of job-based producers (planetary).

### 10.3 The Conversion Layer: Jobs, Strata, and Allocation

Jobs (`common/pop_jobs/`) are the dominant ongoing production mechanism in Stellaris. Every pop that is not unemployed or a slave of certain types is assigned to exactly one job.

A job definition (again from `03_worker_jobs.txt`) contains:

- `category` — the stratum (worker, specialist, ruler, complex_drone, etc.). This is separate from the economic_category used inside `resources`.
- `resources` block (as above) — the actual production.
- `possible_pre_triggers`, `possible_precalc`, `possible` — gating logic (owner exists, not being purged, can_fill_worker_job, specific ethics/civics, etc.).
- `weight` — a complex numeric expression (often using `value:job_weights_modifier|JOB|...|RESOURCE|...|` script values plus many conditional modifiers) that the pop system uses to decide which available job a pop should take.
- `swappable_data` — allows one job key to present different icons/names/effects under certain triggers (e.g., technician vs mote harvester).
- `overlord_resources` — conditional diversion to the overlord.
- `planet_modifier`, `triggered_planet_modifier`, `country_modifier` etc. — side effects on the planet or owner when the job is filled.
- `promotion` rules for strata mobility.

Strata are not merely cosmetic. They determine political power, demotion/promotion behavior, living standards, and which `possible` blocks are even evaluated.

The allocation process is a repeated matching problem: the game maintains, per planet, a certain number of job slots of each type (from districts + buildings + special sources). Pops are then assigned according to weights, subject to `possible` filters and stratum rules. The resulting headcount per (planet, job) directly multiplies the `produces`/`upkeep` values in that job's resources table.

This is the primary place where "pop simulation" and "resource economy" are coupled in ClauseScript.

### 10.4 Infrastructure and Factoring: Buildings, Districts, and Inline Scripts

Buildings (`common/buildings/`) and districts (`common/districts/`) serve two economic roles simultaneously:

1. They consume resources to exist (their own `resources` block with `category = planet_buildings` or `planet_districts_generator` etc. for cost and upkeep).
2. They create job slots via inline scripts such as:
   ```script
   inline_script = {
       script = jobs/technicians_add
       AMOUNT = @base_rural_district_jobs
   }
   ```
   or directly listing `jobs = { ... }` in older patterns.

Many complex output tables are factored into `common/inline_scripts/output/` (e.g., `foundry_output.txt`, `researcher_output.txt`, `factory_output.txt`). These files contain reusable `produces = { ... }` and `upkeep = { ... }` fragments, often with multiple triggered variants for catalytic processing, robot empires, etc. A job or building then does:

```script
resources = {
    category = planet_metallurgists
    inline_script = "output/foundry_output"
}
```

This factoring is critical for maintainability and for any transpiler that wants to detect "the same economic recipe appearing in multiple places."

Districts also declare `zone_slots` and conversion rules (e.g., `convert_to = { ... }`), enabling the later "production methods" style expressiveness through district and building swappability rather than a dedicated production method block type.

### 10.5 Classification, Inheritance, and the Modifier Generation Engine: Economic Categories

The `economic_category` definitions (`common/economic_categories/`) are the single most important piece of infrastructure for turning the raw `resources` tables into a manipulable, moddable economy.

From the authoritative `99_README_ECONOMIC_CATEGORIES.txt`:

- Every object that produces or consumes declares `category = <name>`.
- The category hierarchy (via `parent =`) creates inheritance for modifiers.
- `generate_mult_modifiers = { produces upkeep cost }` and `generate_add_modifiers = { ... }` cause the game to synthesize hundreds of modifier keys of the form:
  `planet_miners_minerals_produces_mult`
  `planet_technician_energy_upkeep_add`
  `orbital_mining_deposits_minerals_produces_add`
  etc.
- These generated modifiers are logged in `script_documentation/modifiers.log` (the 3.79 MB file).
- `modifier_category = pop_job / country / planet / megastructure` tells the engine at what granularity the modifier is allowed to be applied and prevents leakage.
- `triggered_produces_modifier` (and equivalents for cost/upkeep) allow conditional generation of extra modifier families (e.g., `planet_jobs_simple_drone` only for gestalt owners).
- `use_for_ai_budget = yes` marks the category as something the AI may be told to prioritize or deprioritize.
- Inheritance rule: `_mult` modifiers normally propagate to children; `_add` modifiers do not (explicitly to avoid cascades).

The result is that a tradition, edict, civic, technology, species trait, governor trait, or planet modifier can say `planet_miners_minerals_produces_mult = 0.15` and it will automatically affect every job whose economic category is `planet_miners` or any descendant — without the author of the tradition having to enumerate jobs.

This is the mechanism that makes "capability trees" (traditions, edicts, ascension perks) economically participatory at scale.

### 10.6 Attribution and Capture: Who Actually Receives the Resources?

The script never produces "into the aether." Every flow has an owner at the moment of evaluation. Several scoping and diversion mechanisms determine who captures the value:

**Primary attribution**
- Most `resources` blocks on planets, jobs, buildings, and districts are evaluated in a context where `owner` (the country that owns the planet) is the claimant.
- The final net production after all modifiers is added to that country's stockpiles (or the appropriate ledger).

**Subject / Overlord capture**
- When a planet has one of the `has_*_requisitorium` flags (set by subject agreement terms or subject_type mechanics), the job's normal `resources` block still fires for the subject, but an additional `overlord_resources` block fires and writes into a `planet_requisitioned_*` category.
- The overlord's economy then receives the diverted amount. This is visible in the AI budget under those requisitioned categories.
- Multiple parallel diversions (energy, minerals, research, consumer goods, alloys) can be active on the same planet for different overlord benefits.

**Controller vs Owner**
- Occupied planets have a `controller` that is not the `owner`. Some effects and modifiers key off `controller` rather than `owner`. Production attribution in such cases follows the owner for most economic purposes, but certain occupation policies or events can redirect flows.

**Sector and Governor scoping**
- Sectors and the leaders assigned as governors apply modifiers that are scoped to the planets and pops under them. A governor trait that gives `planet_jobs_minerals_produces_mult` only affects the planets in that governor's sector.

**Trade, Market, and Agreement layers**
- `trade_routes`, `trade_policy` (which calls `set_trade_conversions` in `on_enabled`), galactic market, and `agreement_resources` create additional directed flows between countries that are not simple owner capture of local production.

The net effect is that the same physical pop working the same job definition can contribute to multiple countries' ledgers depending on the current web of ownership, subject contracts, occupation, and trade policies.

### 10.7 Policy, Government, and Civic Overlays as Runtime Governors

Policies (`common/policies/00_policies.txt`) and government/civic choices are not merely flavor. They are active participants in the production graph:

```script
economic_policy = {
    option = {
        name = "economic_policy_military"
        modifier = {
            planet_jobs_alloys_produces_mult = 0.25
            planet_jobs_consumer_goods_produces_mult = -0.25
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

These directly target the generated modifier keys (`planet_jobs_*_produces_mult`). Because the keys are generated from the economic_category hierarchy, a single policy line can affect dozens of underlying jobs.

`on_enabled` effects in policy options commonly call scripted effects that do `set_trade_conversions`, add/remove edicts, or set planet/country flags that later appear in job `trigger` blocks or `overlord_resources` conditions.

Civics, government types, and certain resolution categories do the same thing at higher cardinality. The script therefore encodes "economic personality" both in the static weights inside `ai_budget` files and in these dynamic modifier and flag overlays that change which `resources` sub-blocks are active and what multipliers apply.

### 10.8 Directing the Economy: ai_budget as the Economic Personality and Priority System

`common/ai_budget/` contains one file per major resource (plus `00_advanced_logic_budget.txt` and `documentation.txt`).

Each entry is of the form:

```script
minerals_expenditure_planets_med = {
    resource = minerals
    type = expenditure
    category = planets

    potential = {
        resource_stockpile_compare = { resource = minerals value >= 1000 }
        resource_stockpile_compare = { resource = minerals value < 2000 }
    }

    weight = {
        weight = 0.8
        modifier = { factor = ... }
    }

    desired_min = { base = ... }
    desired_max = { base = ... }
}
```

Crucial observations:

- The `category` must have `use_for_ai_budget = yes` in its economic_category definition.
- `potential` is a full trigger block evaluated in country scope; it can disable entire budget lines based on ethics, neighbors, threat, ascension perks, ship type, etc.
- The `weight` values are relative fractions. The AI normalizes across all active budget entries for a resource and tries to spend that share of income on the indicated category.
- `desired_min` / `desired_max` act as soft clamps that bias construction and research choices.
- Separate entries exist for the same resource + category at different stockpile thresholds, allowing the AI to become more or less aggressive about planetary development, station expansion, or armies depending on current reserves.
- There are also upkeep and (in some files) income-side entries.

Because every major producer (jobs, buildings, districts, megastructures, edicts) is tagged with an economic category that the budget files reference, the ai_budget system is the primary "governor" that decides which parts of the implicit production graph the AI will invest in expanding.

Different country types (gestalt, machine, hive, megacorp, authoritarians, crisis aspirants, etc.) have dramatically different active budget entries and potential conditions. This is how ClauseScript encodes "economic personality" without a monolithic AI script.

### 10.9 Feedback Loops, Dependencies, and the Emergent Flow Tree Structure

Production, capability acquisition, and AI decision-making form several tight feedback cycles:

1. Specialist jobs (researchers, bureaucrats, priests, entertainers, etc.) produce research and unity → unlock technologies, traditions, and ascension perks.
2. Those unlocks grant new triggered_modifiers or static modifiers that target the generated `planet_*_produces_mult` keys → increase output of existing jobs or reduce their upkeep.
3. The increased output changes stockpiles → ai_budget re-evaluates weights and desired_min/max → the AI constructs different buildings, opens different districts, or changes policies.
4. New infrastructure creates new job slots → pop growth and migration fill them → the cycle repeats.
5. Subject contracts and trade policies create cross-border edges in the flow graph that are conditional on flags and agreement terms.

Dependencies that a static analyzer or transpiler must track include:

- A job's actual output depends on the current value of every modifier whose key matches its category + resource + direction.
- Modifier values themselves often depend on other production (unity researchers, edict upkeep costs paid from energy, etc.).
- Job slot counts depend on district/building counts, which have their own upkeep costs and prerequisites.
- Trigger conditions inside `produces` blocks can reference planet flags, owner ethics, or even `has_planet_flag` set by distant subject agreements.
- Script values and inline math (`@[ ]`) can create additional dataflow edges at evaluation time.

The resulting structure is not a simple tree. It is a directed graph with:
- Producer nodes (instances of filled jobs, built buildings, active deposits, orbital stations).
- Category ports on each producer.
- Multiplier edges coming from the modifier system (many-to-many).
- Claim/capture edges from producers to owner country ledgers (primary).
- Transfer edges (overlord_resources, trade, market, resolutions) that cross country boundaries.
- Construction-rate modulator nodes (the ai_budget entries) that control the birth rate of new producer nodes.

Cycles exist (researchers produce the research that unlocks better researcher output modifiers) and must be resolved by the engine's update ordering or by using previous-tick snapshots for certain calculations.

### 10.10 Transpiler and Interpreter Considerations for Resource Flow Graphs

Any system that wants to ingest ClauseScript economies and produce an equivalent (or abstractable) resource flow model in another engine must solve the following reconstruction problems:

- **Category normalization**: Build the full parent tree from all `economic_categories/*.txt` files. Every generated modifier key must be traceable back to the leaf category that produced it.
- **Producer enumeration**: For a given planet state, enumerate every active producer (pop-on-job, building instance, district instance, deposit with station). Each carries its `resources` (and `overlord_resources`) tables plus current scope (owner, controller, governor, sector).
- **Modifier stack reconstruction**: Maintain, at the appropriate granularity (planet, pop_job, country, megastructure), the live set of additive and multiplicative modifiers that target each generated key. Order of application (add vs mult, base vs scaled) must match the original engine.
- **Trigger and flag sensitivity**: Every conditional `produces` sub-block and every `overlord_resources` block depends on runtime boolean state (planet flags, owner type, subject contracts). These act as dynamic edge activators in the flow graph.
- **Ownership and transfer slicing**: The same producer node can have different slices of its output routed to different countries. A correct model must support multi-claimant producers or explicit transfer arcs.
- **ai_budget as policy nodes**: Treat each active ai_budget entry as a modulator that influences the rate at which new producer nodes of certain categories are created. The `potential` and `weight` logic must be evaluable.
- **Performance cliffs**: The modifier generation system can produce thousands of modifier keys. Naïve per-producer re-evaluation on every change is expensive; real engines use dependency tracking or batched recalculation keyed off the economic categories.
- **Duplication and override hazards**: Later mods or DLC files can add new child categories, new triggered_*_modifier blocks, or new ai_budget entries for the same category. Last-wins and collection semantics must be preserved exactly.
- **Inline script and value: expansion**: Before building the graph, all `inline_script` references and `value:` usages inside resources blocks must be resolved (or represented as deferred nodes).

A high-fidelity resource flow representation derived from ClauseScript will therefore contain:
- A set of category nodes (with inheritance).
- A dynamic population of producer instances with (resource, category, base_amount, current_modifiers) state.
- Owner/transfer attribution edges.
- Modifier application edges.
- Construction policy nodes (ai_budget) that close the loop back to producer creation.

This structure is what allows traditions, edicts, species traits, and government forms defined in completely separate files to meaningfully participate in the economy without any of those files containing explicit "resource flow" wiring. The wiring is an emergent property of the category + modifier + scope + budget system.

## 11. Diplomatic Actions, Subjects, Federations, and the Galactic Community

These systems control how polities relate to each other at scale.

### 11.1 Diplomatic Actions

Defined in `common/diplomatic_actions/`. Each action has:
- `potential`
- `allow`
- `effect` (what happens when accepted)
- `ai_will_do`
- Various UI and animation hooks

### 11.2 Subject Types and Overlord Mechanics

Subject relationships are defined with rich scripting:
- Different subject types (vassal, tributary, protectorate, etc.)
- Integration speed, loyalty mechanics, subject integration events
- Special subject interactions (asking for help, limited diplomacy, etc.)

### 11.3 Federations and the Galactic Community/Imperium

These are higher-order political constructs with their own laws, levels, and resolution systems. They have complex scripting around:
- Federation laws
- Federation fleet contribution
- Galactic resolutions and emergencies
- The transition from Community to Imperium

### 11.4 Transpiler Notes

These systems are where **polity-to-polity** relationships and higher-order governance are modeled. They interact heavily with:
- Opinion and threat systems
- AI decision weights
- Event scripting
- Resource contributions (federation fleets, galactic market, etc.)

A transpiler that wants to handle multi-polity interactions or "meta" political structures will need to model these carefully.

**Summary of what was added:**

I have now added engineering-grade sections covering all the major gaps I previously identified:

- Modifiers (the actual system)
- Variables / Script Values
- On Actions
- Resource Production, Dependencies, Governance, and Flow (expanded treatment of economic categories, jobs, deposits, ai_budget, attribution, and emergent flow graphs)
- Diplomatic / Subject / Federation systems

These, combined with the earlier sections on Scopes, Triggers, Effects, AI, Capability Trees, and Maps, bring the document to a much more complete state for someone trying to build a high-fidelity transpiler or interpreter for Clausewitz scripting.

A correct and robust implementation for consuming ClauseScript generally follows a multi-stage pipeline. Each stage produces a more structured and semantically enriched representation.

## 12. Parsing, Compilation, and Hydration Pipeline

A correct and robust implementation for consuming ClauseScript generally follows a multi-stage pipeline. Each stage produces a more structured and semantically enriched representation.

### 12.1 Stage 1: Lexical Analysis

Conversion of raw bytes (UTF-8 or Windows-1252) into a token stream. Must correctly handle the limited set of lexical rules and preserve all scalar values exactly (including encoding).

### 12.2 Stage 2: Structural Parsing (Tape / Event Model)

Conversion of the token stream into a flat or tree-structured representation that captures block nesting, mixed container transitions, headers, and operator information.

High-performance implementations often use a flat "tape" with forward/backward pointers rather than a traditional recursive AST.

### 12.3 Stage 3: Scope and Symbol Resolution

Assignment of scopes to every statement. Resolution of special navigation scopes (`root`, `from`, `prev`) relative to the execution context in which a definition will eventually be used.

### 12.4 Stage 4: Raw Definition Extraction

Construction of language-neutral "raw" objects that closely mirror the script structure but are strongly typed within the host language (e.g., `RawCountryDefinition`, `RawTradition`, `RawEvent`).

At this stage, duplication semantics are usually still represented as ordered sequences rather than maps.

### 12.5 Stage 5: Compilation / Hydration (Domain Transformation)

This is the most game-specific and architecturally significant stage. It typically includes:

- Reference resolution (looking up named entities across multiple definition files)
- Modifier compilation (converting modifier blocks into efficient runtime representations)
- Graph construction (tech trees, tradition prerequisites, building upgrade paths)
- Effect and trigger compilation (turning script into executable or analyzable forms)
- Validation against domain invariants
- Baking and optimization (pre-computing values that are constant after hydration)

Only after this stage do objects become suitable for use in a running simulation.

**Further Clarification Sources for This Section**

- Observation of real DLC and patch diffs in the `common/` folders reveals the evolutionary invariants the language has preserved.

---

## 13. Architectural Principles and Invariants

Successful long-term ingestion systems for ClauseScript tend to respect the following principles:

- **Definition vs. Instance separation** must be explicit. Script almost never describes live objects directly.
- **Ordered duplication** must be preserved until a deliberate policy is applied.
- **Scope is part of semantics**, not just syntax. Any representation that discards scope context is lossy.
- **Triggers and effects are distinct categories**. Systems that conflate them lose important static analysis opportunities.
- **Modifiers are first-class** and should be representable independently of the objects that apply them.
- **Hydration is not optional**. Attempting to use raw parsed script directly in a simulation is a common source of complexity and bugs.
- **The language is evolutionary**. Any robust system must tolerate missing keys, deprecated constructs, and new syntactic forms across versions.

---

## 14. Case Studies in Data Modeling

### 13.1 Countries and Empires

Typically defined via a combination of static definition files and history files. Key modeling concerns include:

- Core/claim collections (high duplication)
- Idea and tradition graphs
- Starting leader and advisor instantiation
- Initial diplomatic and economic state

### 13.2 Military Formations and Units

Unit type definitions, regiment templates, army compositions. Important patterns include:

- Stat blocks and combat roles
- Persistent per-regiment state (experience, morale, strength)
- Template instantiation vs. individual tracking

### 13.3 Characters and Agents

One of the richest domains. Common elements:

- Static history vs. dynamic generation
- Skill, trait, and relationship graphs
- Temporal state (health, stress, opinion)
- Title and office holding

### 13.4 Events and Decisions

The primary vehicle for dynamic narrative and player interaction. Modeling concerns include:

- Trigger compilation for eligibility checking
- Effect sequencing and side effects
- AI weighting functions
- Context passing via `from`/`root`

### 13.5 Buildings and Economic Infrastructure

One of the cleanest mappings to resource flow systems:

- Production method definitions
- Input/output and upkeep specifications
- Construction state machines
- Upgrade and replacement graphs

### 13.6 Traditions and Cultural Systems

Graph-structured, cumulative modifier systems. Key aspects:

- Prerequisite DAGs
- Incompatibility rules
- Modifier application targets and stacking rules
- Adoption and removal mechanics

### 13.7 Technology and Progression Trees as Capability Structures

Technology trees in Clausewitz represent one of the most fully realized examples of long-term, gated capability acquisition in the scripting language. While they share DNA with Traditions and other progression systems, they have distinct mechanical and design characteristics that are worth treating in depth.

#### Structural Model

Technologies are defined as individual objects with the following key properties:

- **Cost model**: Can be a fixed number or a dynamic block with `factor` and multiple `modifier` entries that respond to game state (is_active_resolution, has_technology, etc.).
- **Area**: One of society / engineering / physics. This is not merely cosmetic — it ties into research leader assignment, scientist traits, and certain modifiers.
- **Tier**: Explicit progression level. Prerequisites are expected to be from the previous tier in the same or related categories.
- **Prerequisites**: A list of other technology keys. This creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- **Category**: One or more research categories (e.g., `archaeostudies`, `computing`, `materials`). These are used for weighting, rarity, and certain event triggers.
- **is_rare**: Boolean that affects draw weight and often triggers special events or archaeology interactions.
- **feature_flags**: A set of string identifiers that unlock hard game features (gateway activation, certain ship components, edict types, etc.). These are often the most important "capability" granted.
- **weight / weight_modifier**: Base draw chance for the technology in the research card pool, modified by many conditions.
- **technology_swap**: Allows the same base technology to present differently (different name, icon, or effects) based on a trigger. This is heavily used for species archetype divergence (e.g., biological vs machine empires).

Example skeleton from actual definitions:

```script
example_technology = {
    cost = {
        factor = 1000
        modifier = { factor = 0.5 is_active_resolution = "some_resolution" }
    }
    area = society
    tier = 3
    prerequisites = { previous_tech }
    category = { archaeostudies }
    is_rare = yes
    feature_flags = { gateway_activation special_component_unlock }
    weight = 100
    weight_modifier = { ... }
}
```

#### Capability Tree Characteristics

From a capability perspective, tech trees have several notable properties:

- **Incremental and compounding**: Each technology typically adds one or more modifiers, unlocks new buildings/jobs/components, or grants a feature flag. Effects are usually permanent.
- **High fan-out and cross-linking**: A single technology can affect multiple subsystems (economy, military, diplomacy, exploration). Cross-category prerequisites are common.
- **Research as the gating resource**: Unlike Traditions (which use Unity) or Edicts (which have direct upkeep), the primary cost of technology is time + scientist skill + research output. This creates a different economic tension.
- **Rarity and special paths**: The `is_rare` flag and archaeology-related technologies create high-variance "jackpot" capabilities that are not guaranteed.
- **Archetype and empire-type divergence**: `technology_swap` and `allowed_archetypes` / triggers allow the same conceptual technology to manifest very differently depending on the empire's fundamental identity (biological vs synthetic, hive mind, etc.).

#### Execution and Evaluation Model

When the game evaluates the research card pool:

1. It collects all technologies the empire has the prerequisites for and has not yet researched.
2. It applies weight modifiers based on current state (scientist traits, previous research, special projects completed, etc.).
3. Rare technologies get additional draw logic.
4. Once chosen, the technology begins "researching." Upon completion:
   - All listed `modifier` blocks are applied (usually permanently to the country).
   - All `feature_flags` become available empire-wide.
   - Any associated events or on_actions may fire.
   - New buildings, components, edicts, or jobs become constructable/usable.

Because many technologies grant modifiers that affect resource production or research speed itself, there is a strong feedback loop between current capabilities and future research velocity.

#### Interaction with Other Systems

Technology trees intersect heavily with:

- **Economy**: Direct production modifiers, new resource types, cost reductions, job unlocks.
- **Military**: New ship components, starbase modules, army types, bombardment stances.
- **Diplomacy / Subjects**: Technologies that affect subject integration, federation fleet contribution, or galactic market access.
- **Exploration / Narrative**: Many rare or archaeology-linked technologies gate major story or gameplay branches.
- **AI Decision Making**: AI personalities have strong `ai_will_do` and weight modifiers around research priorities (materialist empires heavily favor physics/engineering, spiritualist empires favor society, etc.).

### 13.8 Species and Racial Identity as Foundational Capability Systems

While technology trees represent acquired capabilities over time, **species** (races) represent the foundational identity layer from which many capabilities derive or are constrained.

In Clausewitz scripting, a species is not merely cosmetic or a source of flavor text. It is a first-class object with its own persistent state and a complex web of traits, rights, and modification paths.

#### Core Species Definition

A species is defined by:

- **Archetype**: BIOLOGICAL, LITHOID, ROBOT, MACHINE, etc. This is one of the strongest gating factors in the entire game.
- **Traits**: A set of modifiers and special rules. Traits have categories (normal, cyborg, robotic, psionic, overtuned, etc.) and can be mutually exclusive or gated.
- **Habitability preferences**: Either via dedicated preference traits (`trait_pc_desert_preference`) that set `ideal_planet_class`, or through `bound_to_planet_classes`.
- **Portrait and name lists**: Mostly presentation, but can carry minor mechanical hooks in some contexts.

Species traits themselves are rich objects:

```script
trait_pc_desert_preference = {
    allowed_archetypes = { BIOLOGICAL PRESAPIENT LITHOID }
    modifier = {
        pc_desert_habitability = 0.80
        pc_arid_habitability = 0.60
        # ...
    }
    ai_weight = { weight = 0 }  # Usually not chosen randomly
}
```

Many traits also carry `cost` blocks (with base + conditional modifiers), `sorting_priority`, `allowed_ethics`, `allowed_civics`, `allowed_origins`, and `assembly_score` for pop growth logic.

#### Species as a Form of Capability Tree

Although a species starts with a fixed set of traits at creation, Clausewitz provides multiple mechanisms to evolve or expand that set over time:

- **Genetic modification / gene tailoring** (tech-gated)
- **Cybernetic / Psionic / Synthetic ascension paths** (tradition/ascension perk gated)
- **Overtuned / Malleable / Mutation** trait categories (more recent experimental systems)
- **Assimilation** and species rights changes
- **Auto-mod traits** (pops can automatically swap traits within a category based on job needs)

This makes a species less like a static race and more like a **foundational capability platform** that can be upgraded along multiple axes through research, traditions, and special projects.

#### Interaction with Economy and Simulation

Species traits and rights directly affect:

- Pop output (resource production, amenities, trade value)
- Pop upkeep and political power
- Growth and assembly rates
- Job suitability and weight
- Habitability (which gates colonization and output on different planets)
- Leader generation pools

Because pops are the primary workers in most economies, species-level traits are one of the highest-leverage long-term economic decisions in the game. A single powerful species trait (or a well-chosen set) can outperform many individual building or tradition bonuses when multiplied across thousands of pops.

#### Scoping and Evaluation

Species and their traits are evaluated in multiple scopes:
- `species` scope (the species object itself)
- `pop` / `pop_group` scope (individual pops carrying the species + traits)
- Country scope (when checking empire-wide species policies or main species)

This multi-scope nature means that species capabilities must be modeled carefully in any transpiler — a trait bonus may apply at the pop level for production but at the species level for leader generation or habitability.

#### Architectural Observations for Capability Modeling

When viewing both Technology Trees and Species through a "capability tree" lens, several patterns emerge:

- **Foundational vs Acquired layers**: Species represent the base layer (with some upgrade paths). Technologies represent the primary acquired layer.
- **Graph + Gating**: Both use prerequisite graphs. Technologies tend to be more linear/tiered; species modification paths are often gated behind major tradition or research branches.
- **Persistent, multiplicative impact**: Both systems tend to apply permanent or long-duration modifiers that compound with other systems.
- **Identity divergence**: Technology swaps and species archetype mechanics allow the same conceptual "tree" to produce very different capabilities depending on earlier identity choices.
- **Economic leverage**: Both are major drivers of long-term resource advantage, often more important than individual buildings or short-term edicts.

For a transpiler, these two systems are excellent candidates for unified modeling as different flavors of capability acquisition graphs, with different gating resources (research output vs genetic/synthetic modification points) and different scopes of application (empire-wide unlocks vs pop/species level traits).

This framing makes it much easier to design generic "capability tree" handling logic that can consume both technology and species modification data without special-casing every game system.

## 15. Maps and Spatial Structures in Clausewitz

Maps in Clausewitz games represent one of the most significant areas of evolution in the engine. The approach to spatial representation differs substantially between older titles and newer ones, particularly Stellaris.

### 14.1 Two Paradigms of Map Implementation

Clausewitz has used two fundamentally different approaches to maps:

**Traditional Province-Based Maps** (EU4, CK2, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron series):
- The map is defined primarily through image assets (typically BMP files).
- A "provinces" bitmap defines the base spatial units (provinces or states).
- Additional bitmaps or data files define height, rivers, terrain, climate, etc.
- A `definition.csv` (or similar) maps color values in the province bitmap to province IDs and properties.
- Adjacency (borders, straits, etc.) is often derived from the image data or defined in separate files.
- This model gives designers pixel-level control but creates large binary assets and complex synchronization between images and data files.

**Data-Driven / Procedural Maps** (Stellaris and later approaches):
- The map is primarily defined through structured text files rather than images.
- Spatial layout is generated at runtime or load time according to parameters.
- Individual locations (star systems in Stellaris) are explicit objects that can be referenced by ID.
- Connections (hyperlanes in Stellaris) are explicitly declared or algorithmically generated rather than being implicit borders.

### 14.2 Stellaris Galaxy Map Implementation

In Stellaris, the map system is centered around **galaxy generation** rather than a fixed image-based layout.

#### Core Files and Locations

- `map/setup_scenarios/` — Contains the primary definitions for different galaxy sizes and types (`tiny.txt`, `small.txt`, `medium.txt`, `large.txt`, `huge.txt`, plus `static_galaxy_example.txt`).
- `map/galaxy/galaxy_shapes.txt` — Defines the geometric templates for galaxy shapes (elliptical, ring, spiral variants).

#### Setup Scenario Structure

A typical `setup_scenario` (from `medium.txt`) declares high-level parameters:

```script
setup_scenario = {
    name = "medium"
    priority = 2
    default = yes

    num_stars = 600
    radius = 400

    num_empires = { min = 0 max = 18 }
    num_empire_default = 9

    # Cluster (empire starting area) generation
    cluster_count = {
        method = one_every_x_empire
        value = 1
        max = 6
    }
    cluster_radius = 120
    cluster_distance_from_core = 250

    max_hyperlane_distance = 50

    # Partitioning logic for home systems vs open space
    home_system_partitions = { ... }
    open_space_partitions = { ... }

    num_nebulas = 6
    num_wormhole_pairs = { min = 0 max = 5 }
    num_gateways = { min = 0 max = 5 }
    num_hyperlanes = { min = 0.5 max = 3 }
    ...
}
```

Key concepts visible here:
- **Stars** are the fundamental spatial unit (analogous to provinces in older games).
- **Clusters** are used to create defensible starting regions for empires.
- **Hyperlanes** are the primary connection graph (explicitly generated with distance and density controls).
- Special features (nebulas, wormholes, gateways) are configured as overlays on the base star layout.

#### Galaxy Shapes

Shapes in `galaxy_shapes.txt` provide geometric constraints:

```script
spiral_2 = {
    core_radius_perc = 0.3
    num_stars_core_perc = 0

    num_arms = 2
    arms = {
        tightness_winding = 1.1
        width = 80.0
        fuzz = 25.0
        seperation = 180.0
    }
    ...
}
```

This demonstrates that even "procedural" maps are heavily parameterized rather than purely random.

#### Static Galaxies

Stellaris also supports fully hand-authored maps via `static_galaxy_scenario`:

```script
system = { 
    id = "15" 
    name = "" 
    position = { x = 7 y = 33 z = 4} 
    initializer = dyson_sphere_init_01 
}
```

This allows precise placement of systems with explicit coordinates and initializer scripts. Static scenarios are useful for story-driven or highly curated content.

### 14.3 Scripting Implications of the Map System

Because maps in Stellaris are collections of discrete, addressable systems rather than continuous provinces, scripting interacts with the map differently than in older titles:

- Systems are first-class objects that can be directly referenced (`galactic_object` scope).
- Many effects and triggers operate on systems rather than abstract "provinces."
- Initializer scripts (`common/solar_system_initializers/`) are the primary mechanism for populating a system with content when it is created.
- Hyperlane connectivity can be queried and sometimes modified at runtime.
- Distance and pathfinding (hyperlane distance) are explicit concepts in the scripting language.

### 14.4 General Engineering Observations

Across Clausewitz titles, maps tend to follow these patterns:

1. **Strong separation between geometry and content.** Geometry (positions, connections) is usually defined separately from what exists at those locations.
2. **Initialization as a distinct phase.** Many map objects are created empty or minimally and then populated by initializer scripts or history files.
3. **Graph + overlay model.** The base structure is often a graph (hyperlanes, borders, connections), with additional layers (deposits, features, ownership) applied on top.
4. **Scope-aware spatial queries.** Effects and triggers that operate on the map are heavily constrained by current scope (e.g., you cannot directly manipulate a distant system without proper scope changes or event targets).

This spatial model has significant implications for any transpiler or simulation layer built on top of ClauseScript, particularly regarding ownership, visibility, pathfinding, and event propagation.

## 16. Savegame Format and Reification into Clausewitz Script / Tree Data

Savegames are the complete persisted runtime state of a Clausewitz title captured at a discrete moment. They are not merely "snapshots" in the colloquial sense; they are full serializations of the hydrated object graph that the engine maintains while running: every country, planet, pop, ship, fleet, leader, army, war, starbase, deposit, market transaction, archaeological site, and diplomatic relation, together with all active modifiers, variables, timers, production assignments, and scope references.

For any engineering effort whose goal is to load, interpret, transform, or simulate ClauseScript content at the level of real game data, the savegame path is indispensable. Definition files in `common/` describe *templates and rules*. Savegames describe *what actually exists right now*, with every runtime property materialized. The ability to ingest a save and obtain the identical "script or tree" representation used for authored content is what allows a transpiler or interpreter to treat a player's actual empire at 2350.01.01 as just another (very large) ClauseScript document.

### 15.1 The Envelope Container (SAV Header + Payload)

All modern Paradox saves that follow the post-Jomini-engine layout begin with a single ASCII header line on disk:

```
SAV<vv><kk><8 random bytes><8-byte meta length hex>[optional 8-byte pad]\r?\n
```

- `SAV` magic (literal bytes 53 41 56).
- `vv`: two hex digits encoding the envelope version (observed values 01 and 02).
- `kk`: two hex digits encoding `SaveHeaderKind`:
  - 00 = Text (uncompressed plaintext gamestate follows)
  - 01 = Binary (uncompressed binary token stream follows)
  - 02 = UnifiedText (text metadata, compressed text gamestate)
  - 03 = UnifiedBinary (binary metadata, compressed binary gamestate)
  - 04 = SplitText (metadata lives in the ZIP; gamestate is compressed text)
  - 05 = SplitBinary (metadata lives in the ZIP; gamestate is compressed binary)
- 8 random bytes (often used for save identification or rolling).
- 8 hex digits giving the declared length of the metadata section in bytes.
- Optional 8-byte padding block (used in version 02+ extended headers).
- A single `\n` or `\r\n` terminator.

Immediately after the header line the payload begins. The payload is *either*:

- Raw content (text script or binary tokens) whose length is implied by the file size minus header, or
- A standard ZIP archive whose central directory can be located by scanning backward from the end of the file (the envelope layer deliberately performs this scan with a 64 KiB window even when the header claims the save is uncompressed).

When the payload is a ZIP, two well-known entries are expected:

- `gamestate` — the authoritative full world state (usually the overwhelming majority of bytes). May be stored with Deflate compression.
- `meta` — a much smaller block containing player name, current date, game version, ironman flag, checksums, and other bookkeeping. In "unified" layouts this block is inlined between the SAV header and the first ZIP local header rather than stored as a separate ZIP member.

The envelope abstraction guarantees that callers can request a decompressed `Read` stream for either the gamestate or the metadata without caring whether the on-disk representation was plain text, plain binary, unified ZIP, or split ZIP. Deflate decompression (when required) is performed transparently.

### 15.2 Text Gamestate Path

When the extracted gamestate stream is text-encoded:

- The bytes are syntactically and semantically ordinary ClauseScript. They can be tokenized, parsed into a `TextTape`, streamed via a text token reader, or fed to any deserializer that accepts the plaintext dialect.
- Every construct that appears in hand-authored script appears here: unquoted and quoted scalars, `=` and comparison operators, bare blocks, headers (`rgb`, `hsv`, `list`, etc.), mixed containers, ghost objects `{}`, parameter blocks `[[var] ... [[!var] ... ]`, and `$PARAM$` substitution sites (though the latter are usually already expanded in a live save).
- The full ordered sequence of duplicate keys is preserved exactly as written by the engine. This is the same representation that definition files use; the only difference is volume and the fact that values are concrete runtime observations rather than template expressions.

Text saves (or "debug" / observer saves) are therefore the easiest path for human inspection and for uniform tooling that already knows how to walk definition trees.

### 15.3 Binary Gamestate Path and the Token Stream Model

When the extracted gamestate is binary-encoded, the content is a compact, type-tagged token stream rather than character text. The lexer level recognizes a small set of structural and value-carrying lexemes, almost all introduced by a 16-bit little-endian ID:

Structural markers (fixed):
- `0x0003` — OPEN (`{`)
- `0x0004` — CLOSE (`}`)
- `0x0001` — EQUAL (`=`)

Value-carrying tokens:
- `Id(u16)` — the dominant form for keys and many identifiers; the u16 is an index into a game- and patch-specific string table (the "token resolver"). Tables routinely contain well over ten thousand entries.
- `U32`, `U64`, `I32`, `I64`, `Bool` — fixed-width integers and booleans.
- `F32` (4 raw bytes), `F64` (8 raw bytes) — floating point whose exact interpretation (endianness, special values) is supplied by a `BinaryFlavor` implementation.
- `Quoted(Scalar)`, `Unquoted(Scalar)` — length-prefixed or otherwise delimited text.
- `Rgb` — three-byte color.
- Newer variants (EU5-era and forward): `LOOKUP_*` indirection, `FIXED5_*` fixed-point decimals, compact zero constants, etc.

A streaming `TokenReader` over binary data yields these tokens one by one. The reader is deliberately low-level: it does **not** tell the caller whether a given `OPEN` begins an object (keyed map), an array (positional list), or a mixed container. It also does not skip ghost objects. All such structure is either inferred by a higher layer (the serde deserializer) or built explicitly by a tree-walking consumer that maintains its own container stack.

Floating-point and date values are the most common sources of fidelity bugs; the correct `BinaryFlavor` for a given title and patch must reproduce the exact same bit patterns the writing engine used.

### 15.4 Convergence: TextTape, DOM Trees, Serde, and Melting

All four representations ultimately describe the same logical tree of blocks, scalars, and operators:

1. **TextTape (text path)**: A single contiguous `Vec<TextToken>` using `end: usize` back-pointers on every `Object { end, mixed }` and `Array { end, mixed }` token. This yields an allocation-free tree: the children of the object that begins at index `i` occupy the contiguous range `i+1 .. tape[i].end`. The mixed flag, `Header`, `Parameter`, `UndefinedParameter`, and non-`=` `Operator` tokens are first-class citizens. This representation is the one chosen by high-performance loaders precisely because a multi-gigabyte save can be parsed into a few hundred megabytes of tape and then traversed with excellent cache behavior.

2. **Generic DOM / Value tree (either path)**: Walk the TextTape (or the binary TokenReader + resolver) and emit a recursive structure (`Map<String, Value>`, `Vec<Value>`, scalar variants). Once constructed, the origin (text vs. binary) is erased. This is the form most convenient for arbitrary JSON-like processing, diffing, or feeding into a simulation substrate.

3. **Serde deserialization (both paths)**: The same `#[derive(JominiDeserialize)]` structs, augmented with `#[jomini(duplicated)]`, `#[jomini(take_last)]`, `#[jomini(alias = "...")]`, and `#[jomini(token = 0xNNNN)]` attributes, can be deserialized from either a text slice/reader or from a binary reader supplied with the matching flavor and resolver. Duplication policy is applied at deserialization time exactly as it would be for definition files.

4. **Re-emitted plaintext script ("melting")**: A binary token stream plus resolver can be walked and the corresponding scalars, operators, and braces emitted through a text writer. The result is a canonical plaintext ClauseScript document that is semantically identical to the save the game would have written had it been a text save. This is the practical meaning of "the savegame expands into a Stellaris script." The emitted text can then be re-parsed with the ordinary text pipeline, completing the round-trip.

Because every layer above the raw lexer preserves the ordered sequence of key occurrences, any downstream consumer that cares about last-wins versus collection semantics (the dominant duplication policies) receives identical information regardless of whether the original on-disk save was text or binary.

### 15.5 Stellaris Save Structure and Scale Characteristics

Stellaris saves are among the largest produced by any Clausewitz title. A typical mid-to-late game file, once decompressed, can exceed several hundred megabytes; extreme cases approach or surpass 2 GB. The dominant contributors are:

- The `pop` or `pops` collection — often tens or hundreds of thousands of individual pop objects, each carrying species, culture, job, strata, happiness, output modifiers, crime, growth state, etc.
- Fleet/ship/army detail — every ship has design, components, hit points, orders, and location.
- Leader, sector, and planet detail — buildings, districts, deposits, blockers, and ongoing construction queues.

Top-level structure is almost always integer-ID keyed maps:

```script
countries = {
    0 = { name = "United Nations of Earth" ... }
    7 = { name = "Commonwealth of Man" ... }
}
planets = { 42 = { ... } 43 = { ... } ... }
ships = { 1001 = { ... } ... }
```

Many keys that are expressions or tables in `common/pop_jobs/`, `common/buildings/`, or `common/traditions/` appear in the save as concrete realized values plus the bookkeeping the engine needs to maintain them (remaining duration on timed modifiers, source scope, stacking identity, etc.).

The `meta` block (or inlined metadata) records the exact game version the save was written under, the ironman flag, and various checksums. This information is essential for any loader that must select the correct token table or flavor.

### 15.6 Transpiler and Simulation Implications

A loaded save is the richest possible starting point for any system built on ClauseScript:

- The complete spatial graph (systems, hyperlanes, ownership, bypasses) is present and consistent.
- The full economic production graph (pops → jobs → categories → resources, plus all active multipliers) can be reconstructed by walking the saved pop and building objects and their modifier lists (see the Resource Production section for the exact category tagging and parent inheritance rules that must be applied).
- Capability state (adopted traditions, active edicts, acquired ascension perks, leader traits, civics) is fully materialized with all granted modifiers and any ongoing upkeep or timers.
- Event and on_action state (active pulses, delayed events, scoped variables with duration) are present as first-class objects.

Because the save is just another (very large) instance of the same tree model used for definitions, the identical scope navigation, trigger evaluation, and effect application machinery can be applied to it. A transpiler that emits both "definition time" artifacts and "runtime hydration" artifacts can therefore use a save as the canonical test vector for equivalence: the behavior observed when the original game loads the save must be reproducible when the transpiled representation is hydrated from the same save data.

### 15.7 Practical Challenges and Non-Obvious Hazards

- **Token table lifecycle**: Binary saves are only parseable with a resolver table that matches the exact patch the save was written on. Tables drift between patches; a robust implementation must either ship per-version tables or be prepared to surface unknown tokens to the caller.
- **Memory and streaming discipline**: Materializing a full DOM for a late-game Stellaris save will exhaust typical developer machines. The end-pointer tape and the raw streaming readers exist precisely so that large subtrees (e.g., the entire `ships` map) can be skipped or processed in bounded memory.
- **Fidelity of numbers and dates**: Even a one-ulp difference in a floating-point modifier or a one-day difference in a date encoding will cause observable divergence in production, growth, and combat calculations. The flavor and date handling must be bit-compatible with the writing engine.
- **Ironman and rolling formats**: Ironman saves add extra layers (sometimes rolling checksums or partial encryption of sensitive state). The structural envelope and token grammar remain the same, but certain semantic fields may be absent or transformed.
- **Duplication surprises**: While definition files are the primary place last-wins and collection merging are exercised, saves can still contain duplicate keys (especially in lists of timed modifiers or in ad-hoc data written by effects). The same policy that the title applies to definitions must be applied to the save tree.
- **Version skew**: A save written under 3.8.4 may contain keys or value shapes that no longer exist (or have changed meaning) in 3.14. The loader must either reject the save or degrade gracefully when the surrounding script definitions have moved on.

### 15.8 Further Clarification Sources for This Section

- Real Stellaris save files (highest fidelity): `Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\save games\` on the user's machine. Both regular and ironman `.sav` files are valuable; load any game, wait for an autosave, then copy the file for offline study. Use envelope-extraction tooling to obtain the raw decompressed gamestate for direct inspection or re-parsing.
- Low-level Clausewitz format parser implementations and their test corpora: the envelope handling (SAV header parser, ZIP vs plain detection, meta/gamestate extraction with transparent decompression), binary lexer (complete LexemeId table including newer fixed-point and lookup forms), binary Token and TokenReader definitions, TextTape construction with end-pointers and mixed-container tracking, and round-trip tests that convert between text and binary forms.
- `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/` (effects.log, triggers.log, modifiers.log, scopes.log) — these describe the *script surface* that can appear inside saves, but the concrete schema of a gamestate (which top-level keys exist, what their shapes are, which runtime bookkeeping fields are written) is only visible by examining actual saved gamestate blobs.
- The detailed public write-up on PDS Clausewitz syntax and the many pitfalls that any robust loader must handle: https://pdx.tools/blog/a-tour-of-pds-clausewitz-syntax
- Production consumers of the format for header layout, melting pipelines, and real-world error cases: the Paradox Game Converters repository and pdx_unlimiter (especially its ModernHeader handling).
- In-game generation of more readable saves: launching with debug flags or using the `observe` console command often produces autosaves whose structure is easier to diff against melted output.

A savegame, once loaded through the envelope and turned into tape or DOM form, is simply the largest and most authoritative ClauseScript document a given title will ever produce. All of the lexical, structural, scoping, duplication, and semantic rules described in the preceding sections apply to it with equal force.

### 15.9 The Fan Tooling and Analysis Ecosystem

The parsed ClauseScript tree (whether from a TextTape, a generic DOM, a custom Node representation, or direct serde structs) is rarely an end product. A rich ecosystem of fan-built tools has been constructed on top of these representations, revealing both the power of the uniform script/tree model and the additional concerns that any serious consumer must address.

**Large-scale, privacy-first analysis and visualization** (pdx.tools and similar browser/WASM tools): Complete save analysis — interactive maps, statistical graphs, achievement progress, diplomatic webs, and territorial timelapses — performed entirely in the browser with no data leaving the user's machine until an explicit share action. These implementations demonstrate that even multi-hundred-megabyte (or larger) saves can be fully ingested and explored client-side when the underlying IR is a compact tape with efficient skipping rather than a fully materialized recursive object graph.

**Live / incremental parsing with derived long-term analytics** (stellaris-dashboard and close relatives): Runs in the background while the player is in-game, detects new autosaves (including Ironman), parses them incrementally, and maintains a persistent database. It surfaces rich time-series graphs (economy, market prices with user-supplied historical fee tables), a filterable event ledger, empire/system/leader statistics, and a historical galaxy map. It can export stepped GIF or per-frame PNG timelapses of territorial control over arbitrary date ranges. Because Stellaris 3.4+ stores most names as abstract localization templates rather than concrete strings, the tool loads the user's actual Stellaris installation and active mods at runtime to resolve them. Extensive configuration (visibility/immersion toggles for other empires, thread count, graph resolution, autosave skipping, layout customization) shows the practical engineering required to turn raw tree data into usable campaign memory without destroying performance or breaking role-play.

**Fast, minimal, battle-tested exporters**: Small, dependency-free command-line tools (notably Go implementations) have been validated against hundreds of real Stellaris saves across many patches. They reliably handle the full envelope (SAV header, ZIP or plain, text or binary gamestate), parse the Clausewitz content, and emit complete JSON representations of 300+ MB saves in a few seconds on ordinary hardware. These serve as the foundation for custom scripts, data pipelines, one-off analyses, and as a stable interchange format for other tools.

**Structured editing, mutation, and campaign management** (PDX-Unlimiter and similar full-featured managers): After parsing, maintains a rich internal hierarchical Node/DOM tree that supports fast navigation, search, filtering, and in-place editing while preserving original syntactic details (quoting choices, key order, headers) far better than naive text substitution. Ironman saves are automatically melted (binary token stream resolved and re-emitted as canonical plaintext) before editing. The same infrastructure provides campaign organization, rollback points, smart launching, and cross-title workflows.

Collectively these tools demonstrate concrete capabilities that the raw tree enables and that a pure loader leaves as exercise for the consumer:

- Faithful reconstruction of spatial ownership graphs, hyperlane connectivity, and dynamic borders directly from the saved `galactic_object` / `starbase` / country data.
- Full economic production/consumption histories and resource flow graphs by walking live pop, job, building, district, and modifier state (exactly the structures described in the Resource Production section).
- Time-series and event history extraction (market prices, leader careers, archaeological progress, war participation) that go far beyond what any single save snapshot contains.
- Safe, round-trippable mutation that respects the many quoting, duplication, and header distinctions the engine cares about.
- Localization and presentation fidelity (name templating, color codes, scripted localization) that often requires joining the parsed save data with the user's installed game files and mods.
- Incremental / streaming / background processing patterns essential for "live" or long-running campaign use.
- Visualization and derived data products (timelapses, ledgers, graphs) as first-class, high-value consumers of the parsed representation.

For transpiler, simulator, or analysis work targeting ClauseScript, the architecture and feature sets of these tools are strong validation that the core IRs (end-pointer tapes, streaming token readers, resolved DOMs) are sufficient, while also surfacing the additional layers (localization rejoining, safe editing disciplines, performance under real-player save sizes, visualization of the reconstructed graphs) that must be built on top.

## 17. Capability Trees, Traditions, Edicts, and Persistent Progression Systems

Clausewitz games make extensive use of unlockable, branching, or gated systems that grant persistent modifiers, new mechanics, or rule changes over the course of a game. In Stellaris these appear as Traditions, Ascension Perks, Edicts, Civics, Origins, and Leader/Species Traits. Similar patterns exist across other titles as Doctrines, National Ideas, Policies, and Talent trees.

These systems are best understood as **capability and progression structures**. They allow designers to create long-term strategic choices that gradually reshape what a player (or AI) can do and how efficiently they can do it.

### 16.1 Definition Patterns

These systems are almost always defined in the `common/` folder under dedicated subdirectories:

- `common/traditions/`
- `common/edicts/`
- `common/ascension_perks/`
- `common/traits/` (species and leader)
- `common/civics/`
- `common/origins/`

A typical Tradition or Edict definition contains several key blocks:

```script
tr_adaptability_recycling = {
    # Prerequisites
    possible = {
        has_tradition = tr_adaptability_adopt
    }

    # Direct static modifiers
    modifier = {
        planet_structures_volatile_motes_upkeep_mult = -0.15
        # ... other resource upkeep reductions
    }

    # Conditional / triggered modifiers
    triggered_modifier = {
        potential = {
            is_wilderness_empire = no
        }
        pop_housing_usage_mult = -0.10
    }

    # AI evaluation
    ai_weight = {
        factor = 10000
    }
}
```

Edicts have an additional `resources` block that directly ties them to the economy:

```script
fortify_the_border = {
    length = @EdictPerpetual

    resources = {
        category = edicts
        cost = {
            unity = @Edict1Cost
            multiplier = value:edict_size_effect
        }
        upkeep = {
            unity = @Edict1Cost
            multiplier = value:edict_size_effect
        }
    }

    modifier = {
        starbase_upgrade_speed_mult = 0.50
        country_starbase_capacity_add = 2
    }
}
```

### 16.2 Tree and Graph Structures

Most capability systems form directed graphs rather than simple linear lists:

- **Prerequisites** are expressed via `possible = { has_tradition = tr_xxx }` or equivalent.
- Some systems support mutually exclusive branches.
- Many have "adopt" and "finish" nodes that unlock additional benefits (extra ascension perk slots, agenda types, etc.).
- Adoption is usually gated behind a resource cost (Unity for Traditions in Stellaris) and sometimes other conditions.

This creates a classic "tech tree" or "talent tree" structure where players invest resources over time to unlock compounding advantages.

### 16.3 Execution and Application Model

When a capability (tradition, edict, civic, etc.) is adopted or activated, the following generally occurs:

1. **Cost is paid** from the relevant resource pool (Unity, Influence, etc.).
2. **The definition is marked as active** on the owning object (usually a country).
3. **Its modifiers are registered** into the global modifier system.
4. **Any `on_enabled` or equivalent scripted effects** are executed.
5. **Ongoing upkeep** (if any) begins being deducted each economic cycle.

For perpetual systems (most Traditions), the modifiers remain active until the capability is removed (which is rare). For Edicts, the `length` field controls duration (`-1` for perpetual, or a number of days).

**Triggered Modifiers** are particularly important. A `triggered_modifier` block contains both a `potential` trigger and a set of modifiers. The modifiers only apply while the `potential` evaluates to true. This allows context-sensitive bonuses (e.g., different effects for Wilderness vs normal empires).

### 16.4 Participation with the Economy

These systems interact with the economy in several distinct ways:

**Direct Resource Costs**
- Initial adoption cost (one-time Unity/Influence expenditure).
- Ongoing upkeep (continuous resource drain while active).

**Modifier Application via Categories**
Scripted modifiers and many built-in ones declare a `category`. This category determines at which level of the economic hierarchy the modifier is applied (country, planet, pop, economic_unit, starbase, etc.). This is crucial for correct stacking and application order.

**Economic Effect Types**
Common effects include:
- Resource output multipliers (`planet_jobs_*_produces_mult`)
- Upkeep reductions (`planet_structures_*_upkeep_mult`)
- Cost reductions for construction and research
- Capacity increases (`country_starbase_capacity_add`, `country_naval_cap_add`)
- Efficiency modifiers on jobs and buildings

Because modifiers are applied at different hierarchical levels, a Tradition that gives a country-level `country_resource_unity_mult` will affect the entire empire, while a planet-level modifier will only affect that planet's output.

**Dynamic Economic Rule Changes**
Some capabilities do more than apply static modifiers. They can:
- Unlock new job types or building slots
- Change which resources are strategic
- Alter edict costs or unity generation
- Enable new production methods indirectly through new buildings or districts

### 16.5 Script Execution Flow

When the game evaluates whether a tradition can be adopted or whether an edict is active:

1. The `possible` / `potential` / `allow` blocks are evaluated as triggers in the appropriate scope (usually the country).
2. Resource costs are checked against current stockpiles and income.
3. If all conditions pass, the capability is adopted and its effects are applied.
4. For ongoing systems, the `potential` blocks of any `triggered_modifier` entries are re-evaluated periodically or on relevant state changes.

This means these systems are not purely static. Their economic impact can turn on and off based on current conditions (empire type, government form, presence of certain buildings, etc.).

### 16.6 AI Evaluation

Almost all such systems include an `ai_weight` block. This is evaluated by the AI to decide priority. Weights can be conditional on current strategic situation (at war, has certain technologies, etc.).

### 16.7 Transpiler and Implementation Considerations

When building a system that must correctly interpret these structures:

- **Model as graphs**, not flat lists. Prerequisites create directed edges.
- **Treat modifiers as a separate concern**. The capability definition should produce modifier descriptors that can be applied to different targets (country, planet, pop, etc.).
- **Preserve conditional logic**. `triggered_modifier` + `potential` blocks represent dynamic application, not static bonuses.
- **Track resource participation explicitly**. Note which resources are used for costs and upkeep, and which economic categories the resulting modifiers affect.
- **Distinguish one-time vs ongoing effects**. Some capabilities grant immediate effects on adoption; others only provide continuous modifiers.
- **Handle unlocking of new content**. Many traditions/edicts unlock new scripted effects, buildings, or jobs that must be registered in the broader system.

These structures are one of the primary ways ClauseScript authors create long-term strategic differentiation and economic specialization without hard-coding every possible combination in the engine.

## 18. AI Construction, Personalities, and Decision Systems in ClauseScript

Clausewitz does not use a single "AI personality" object in the way many other strategy games do. Instead, AI behavior emerges from the interaction of many small, script-defined weights, budgets, stances, and conditional logic. This creates a highly modular and moddable AI system, but one that is significantly more complex to analyze than a traditional personality matrix.

### 17.1 Core Mechanisms of AI Behavior

The script controls AI through several interlocking systems:

1. **Resource Allocation (ai_budget)** — Determines what fraction of income the AI will spend on different categories.
2. **Choice Evaluation (ai_will_do / ai_weight)** — Scores every major decision the AI can make.
3. **Diplomatic and Strategic Stances** — Broad behavioral postures that modify many weights at once.
4. **Event-Driven and On-Action Behavior** — The AI reacts to the world through the same event system as the player, plus dedicated AI hooks.
5. **Modifier Influence** — Many modifiers directly affect AI decision-making (threat, opinion, relative power, etc.).
6. **Leader and Country Traits** — Traits can contain `ai_weight` modifiers that bias behavior.

### 17.2 ai_budget — The Foundation of AI Economy Behavior

The `common/ai_budget/` folder is one of the most important places where AI economic personality is defined.

Each file (e.g., `00_energy_budget.txt`, `00_alloys_budget.txt`) contains entries like:

```script
energy_expenditure_ships = {
    resource = energy
    type = expenditure
    category = ships

    potential = {
        always = yes
    }

    weight = {
        weight = 0.35
        modifier = {
            factor = 1.5
            is_at_war = yes
        }
    }

    desired_min = {
        base = 500
    }
}
```

Key concepts:

- **weight**: Relative priority. All weights for a resource are summed, and the AI tries to spend that proportion of its income.
- **potential**: Conditions under which this budget line applies.
- **desired_min / desired_max**: Soft targets the AI will try to meet before spending elsewhere.
- **category**: Must match an economic category that has `use_for_ai_budget = yes`.

This system directly controls how "aggressive", "tall", "wide", "tech-focused", or "militarist" an AI feels in terms of actual spending.

### 17.3 ai_will_do and ai_weight — The Decision Engine

Nearly every player-facing choice in the game has an `ai_will_do` or `ai_weight` block. This is the primary mechanism for AI decision-making.

Examples appear on:
- Edicts
- Traditions and Ascension Perks
- Diplomatic actions (declaring rivalry, forming federations, etc.)
- War goals and claims
- Building and district construction
- Research choices
- Leader recruitment and assignment

A typical complex `ai_will_do` looks like this (simplified from real files):

```script
ai_will_do = {
    weight = {
        base = 1

        modifier = {
            factor = 5
            is_at_war = yes
        }

        modifier = {
            factor = 0
            NOT = { has_resource = { type = unity amount > 200 } }
        }

        modifier = {
            factor = 2
            has_ascension_perk = ap_machine_intelligence
        }

        # Many more conditional modifiers...
    }
}
```

These weights are evaluated in the current scope of the decision. The AI sums or compares the resulting values to decide what to do.

### 17.4 Risk Perception and Threat Modeling

Risk and threat are not hardcoded. They are expressed through script in several ways:

- **Opinion modifiers** based on AI personality (see `common/opinion_modifiers/01_personality_opinions.txt`).
- **Threat** as a first-class concept that modifies many `ai_will_do` weights.
- **Relative power comparisons** (e.g., `relative_power = { who = from value > equivalent }`).
- **is_at_war**, `has_rival`, `is_threatened_by`, and similar triggers used heavily in AI weights.
- **Border friction** and distance-based modifiers.

An AI's "risk tolerance" emerges from the combination of its budget allocations and the conditional factors in its `ai_will_do` blocks. A "fanatic purifier" personality will have very different weights around war and extermination than a "xenophilic" one.

### 17.5 Diplomatic Stances and Broad Behavioral Postures

Diplomatic stances (defined in `common/diplomatic_stances/`) act as high-level personality switches. They apply large sets of modifiers and change which `ai_will_do` factors are active.

Stances can influence:
- Willingness to declare war
- Federation and alliance behavior
- Trade and migration policy
- How the AI responds to threats and insults

### 17.6 Event-Driven and On-Action AI

A large portion of sophisticated AI behavior is implemented through the normal event system rather than dedicated AI code:

- `on_actions` files contain many entries that only fire for AI countries (`is_ai = yes`).
- These events can force specific behaviors, queue construction, change budgets dynamically, or trigger special decisions.
- Many "personality" differences are actually just different sets of events and effects that fire for AIs of certain types.

### 17.7 Leader Traits and Dynamic Personality

Leader traits (especially ruler and governor traits) can contain `ai_weight` modifiers. This means an AI's behavior can shift over time as different leaders rise and fall, or as it gains/loses specific traits. This creates a form of emergent personality that evolves during a campaign.

### 17.8 Transpiler Considerations for AI Systems

When building a system that must understand or replicate Clausewitz AI behavior:

- **AI is heavily data-driven and emergent.** There is rarely a single "personality" object. Behavior is the sum of hundreds of small weights.
- **ai_budget is the closest thing to a "strategic personality"** for economic behavior.
- **ai_will_do blocks are the primary decision surface.** Any transpiler needs a robust way to evaluate these weight expressions.
- **Scope matters enormously** for AI evaluation, just as it does for normal triggers.
- **Economic categories** in `ai_budget` must be understood in relation to the economy system you are targeting.
- **Conditional weights** often encode complex strategic thinking (fear of a neighbor, desire for a specific resource, long-term vs short-term tradeoffs).
- Many AI behaviors are **event-driven** rather than purely weight-driven. A complete model must handle on_action and event hooks that only apply to AI.

The lack of a single centralized personality definition makes Clausewitz AI both extremely flexible for modders and quite difficult to fully reverse-engineer or port to another system.

- Live game (core sources): `common/ai_budget/` (all files + documentation.txt), `common/personalities/`, `common/diplomatic_stances/`, `common/attitudes/`, `common/opinion_modifiers/`, `common/triggered_modifiers/`.
- `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/triggers.log` and `effects.log` — For the conditions and actions used inside `ai_will_do` and on_action AI hooks.
- `common/on_actions/` and `common/events/` for the event-driven AI layer.
- `common/script_values/` for the complex weighting expressions that drive most decisions.

## 19. Advanced Topics

### 18.1 Binary Format

Many titles store save data in a compact binary representation using 16-bit token IDs instead of strings. A complete ingestion system must support both text and binary forms, ideally sharing the same structural and semantic layers above the token resolution step.

### 18.2 Modding Semantics and Override Rules

Mod loading involves complex interactions between base game content, DLC, and multiple mods. Important concepts include:

- Load order
- File-level vs. object-level replacement
- Patch semantics
- Dependency declarations

### 18.3 Performance and Evaluation Models

Many triggers and effects are evaluated extremely frequently. Engineering considerations include:

- Pre-compilation of expensive conditions
- Caching strategies
- Lazy vs. eager evaluation
- Separation of authoring-time and runtime representations

### 18.4 Versioning and Compatibility

The language and its standard library evolve. Robust systems require:

- Explicit versioning of definitions
- Migration or compatibility layers during hydration
- Graceful handling of unknown constructs

**Further Clarification Sources for This Section**
- The full set of `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/*.log` files — These are the best current-version reference for binary format implications (what the engine actually needs at runtime).
- Live game `common/` + observation of how DLCs and patches add new folders or extend existing ones (the evolutionary pattern).
- `Clauser/Paradox/02_Dynamic_Modding_Scripting_Format.md` — Best single document on the intended extension mechanisms and performance considerations of the modern scripting format.

## 20. Conclusion

ClauseScript is a deceptively simple language whose power and complexity emerge from the interaction of a small number of core concepts: blocks with ambiguous roles, pervasive scoping, duplication as a first-class feature, and a clean separation between declarative definitions and imperative effects.

Any system that aims to correctly ingest, analyze, transform, or execute ClauseScript content must treat these properties as first-class concerns rather than implementation details. The difference between a shallow parser and a semantically faithful transpiler lies almost entirely in how rigorously these aspects are modeled.

This document provides the foundational concepts and structures required for such work.

**Further Clarification Sources for This Section (and the Document as a Whole)**
- Return to the Primary Canonical Reference Sources listed in section 1.1. Those five organized documents plus the live `common/` tree inside the Stellaris installation are the complete, authoritative corpus.
- The game-generated `script_documentation/` logs (regenerated whenever you launch the game) are the only way to stay perfectly in sync with a specific patch or DLC version.
- For any specific system not covered in depth here, the combination of the relevant `common/` folder + the matching entries in `effects.log` / `triggers.log` / `modifiers.log` / `scopes.log` will almost always provide the missing detail.
