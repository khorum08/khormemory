# ClauseThing — Clausewitz Scripting as SimThing's Designer-Facing Language

> **Status:** **Proposal / workshop strategy (2026-05-29).** This document proposes

## 1. Thesis

**ClauseScript and SimThing are the same architecture approached from opposite ends,
and the gap between them is exactly the layer SimThing already has: `simthing-spec`.**

ClauseScript is, in its own textbook's words, *"a declarative definition language
with embedded imperative effects and a sophisticated scoping and parameterization
system. Its primary output is definitions (templates and types), not direct
executable commands. A separate ingestion and hydration layer is always required to
turn these definitions into runtime participants."*

SimThing is the inverse statement: a deterministic, GPU-resident runtime of flat
columns and opaque `AccumulatorOp` registrations, fronted by a spec/driver layer
(`simthing-spec` → `simthing-driver`) whose entire job is to **hydrate authored
definitions into runtime artifacts** while keeping `simthing-sim` semantic-free.

The proposal is constitutionally clean and aspirationally broad:

> **ClauseScript becomes an alternate front-end to `simthing-spec`. A new
> ingestion module (working name `clausething`) parses ClauseScript with `jomini`,
> resolves scopes and references, and emits the *same* `simthing-spec` authoring
> structs that RON authoring produces today. From that point the existing
> compile/admission/install path is unchanged. `simthing-sim` never learns that
> ClauseScript exists.**

This adds **no GPU primitive, no WGSL, no `AccumulatorRole`, no default change, and
no `simthing-sim` awareness**. It is a designer-layer authoring surface — the same
admission firewall the Resource Flow ADR (`resource_flow_substrate.md`) and the
Mapping ADR (`mapping_sparse_regioncell.md`) already establish: *semantics live at
the RON/Designer/spec layer; the runtime sees only flat columns and generic
registrations.* ClauseScript is simply a second dialect spoken at that layer.

### Why bother

- **Density and expressiveness.** ClauseScript is purpose-built for "extremely high
  authoring density" of structured game data + logic. SimThing's RON is correct but
  verbose; a grand-strategy designer authoring economies, capability trees, and AI
  weights wants ClauseScript's idioms (`modifier`, `triggered_modifier`, `resources`,
  `value:`, `ai_will_do`, `possible`).
- **A 20-year-proven design vocabulary.** Paradox's `economic_category` + modifier
  generation, capability trees, `ai_budget`, and on-action model are battle-tested
  solutions to exactly the problems SimThing's economic and mapping ADRs solve from
  first principles. We can adopt the *vocabulary* without adopting the *engine*.
- **A migration corpus.** The world's largest body of grand-strategy content is
  authored in this language. A faithful front-end makes that corpus a reference and
  a test oracle, not a competitor.

### Aspiration

The goal is **full ClauseScript as a first-class, co-equal authoring surface for
SimThing** — not a subset, not a convenience shim, not a "second" option sitting
behind RON. The aspiration is that a designer who knows ClauseScript should be
able to express anything in SimThing that a designer who knows RON can express,
and that the world's existing body of Clausewitz-authored grand-strategy content
becomes a reference corpus and a test oracle rather than a distant competitor.

The tiered ladder (§5) is a **sequencing discipline**, not a scope ceiling. Each
tier is a shippable proof of the mapping; later tiers expand the vocabulary until
the language is fully covered. The runtime constraints (§7) are binding, but they
constrain *how* ClauseScript compiles, not *how much* of it we admit.

**What does not translate and never will:** Presentation-only constructs
(`custom_tooltip`, `defined_text`, portrait/name lists, localization keys) are
dropped before runtime — they have no SimThing equivalent by design. Binary save
format is out of scope — ClauseThing ingests authoring `.txt`, not save games.
These are the only permanent exclusions. Everything else is a sequencing question.

```

Two placement options for the front-end; the proposal recommends **(A)** for
dependency hygiene:

- **(A) Separate crate `simthing-clausewitz` (recommended).** Depends on `jomini`
  and on `simthing-spec`'s public authoring structs only. Keeps the `jomini`
  dependency, the Windows-1252/UTF-8 decoding, and the tape/AST machinery out of
  `simthing-spec`. Emits authoring structs; `simthing-spec` stays the single
  admission/firewall owner.
- **(B) A `clausewitz` module inside `simthing-spec`.** Simpler wiring, but pulls
  `jomini` into the admission crate. Rejected unless dependency cost is trivial.

Either way the **firewall is the existing `simthing-spec` admission layer**, not the
parser. ClauseScript is rejected for unsafe *authoring* at import (bad scope,
unbounded fanout, non-deterministic constructs, out-of-class EML); the runtime still
enforces hard safety unconditionally (horizon caps, source-cap clamp, finite/column
validation, bounded fields) exactly as the Mapping ADR requires.

## 3. The ingestion pipeline (jomini-grounded)

ClauseThing follows the five-stage pipeline the textbook §10 (and jomini) prescribe.
The first four stages are generic and game-agnostic; **Stage 5 is the only
SimThing-specific stage** and is where all the tiering lives.

| Stage | What | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Lexing | bytes (Win-1252/UTF-8) → tokens, exact scalar preservation | `jomini` `TextTape` |
| 2. Structural parse | tokens → tape/tree: blocks, mixed containers, headers (`rgb {}`), operators (`= < > <= >= ==`) | `jomini` tape + reader |
| 3. Scope & symbol resolution | assign scope to each statement; resolve `this/root/from/prev` + domain scopes against `scopes.log` Supported/Output rules; resolve dot-paths; expand `[[param]]`, `$PARAM$`, `@[ ]`, `inline_script`, `value:` | ClauseThing |
| 4. Raw definition extraction | typed, language-neutral raw structs (`RawEntity`, `RawResources`, `RawModifier`, `RawCapability`, `RawField`), **duplication preserved as ordered sequences** | ClauseThing |
| 5. Hydration → SimThing artifacts | raw → `simthing-spec` authoring structs (the tiered mapping, §5–6) | ClauseThing → `simthing-spec` |

Stage-3/4 invariants we inherit verbatim from the textbook §11 and must honor:

- **Definition vs. instance separation is explicit** — ClauseScript describes
  templates; instances are the hydrated SimThing tree. (SimThing already enforces
  this: spec → `install_atomic` → tree.)
- **Ordered duplication is preserved until a deliberate policy is applied** — last-
  wins vs collection vs override is a *compile-time policy choice per key*, never a
  parser default. `jomini`'s `duplicated`/`take_last`/`alias` attributes model this
  directly. **Proposed default policy** (so this is a documented decision, not a
  per-project TODO): scalar keys are **last-wins**; keys declared in the spec's
  *list registry* (e.g. `produces`, `modifier`, `prerequisites`) **collect** in
  source order; and an explicit `@override`/`@append` marker (sugar, §6) lets an
  author opt a single key into override-or-merge against an earlier definition. Mod
  load-order merging beyond a single compilation unit is **out of scope for v1**
  (one authoring tree, one policy table) and is itself a later Tier-2 question.
- **Scope is part of semantics, not syntax** — a representation that discards scope
  is lossy. Scope compiles to tree-position + slot/column resolution.
- **Triggers and effects stay distinct categories** — triggers → threshold/EML
  gates; effects → overlays / `BoundaryRequest` / `EmitEvent`.
- **Modifiers are first-class** — they compile to overlays, independent of the
  object that hosts them.

`jomini` also gives us, for free: a JSON projection of any parsed document (debug /
golden-file testing), a write API (round-trip / canonicalization), and a fuzzed,
>1 GB/s parser. Binary save format support exists in `jomini` but is permanently
out of scope for ClauseThing — we ingest authoring `.txt`, not save games (§10).

---

## 4. The deep correspondence (why the mapping is natural)

Every load-bearing ClauseScript construct has a direct SimThing counterpart that
**already exists**. This table is the spine of the whole proposal.

| ClauseScript construct | SimThing artifact it compiles to | Existing SimThing reference |
|---|---|---|
| Definition file / block | spec authoring struct → SimThing template | `install_clone_then_commit.md` |
| Block-as-object / array / mixed | keyed property block / positional list | jomini reader |
| `this/root/from/prev`, domain scopes, dot-paths | tree navigation + event context (`root`/`from` = `EmitEvent` payload) | `state-authority.md` |
| Trigger (boolean) | `Threshold` gate over a property column | Pass 7 / `ThresholdRegistration` |
| `AND/OR/NOT/NAND/NOR/calc_true_if` | boolean algebra in `EvalEML` (`SELECT`/`CMP`) + threshold combination | EvalEML, `design_v7.md` |
| Effect (mutation) | overlay `PropertyTransformDelta` / `BoundaryRequest` / `EmitEvent` | `overlay.rs`, `work.rs` |
| `hidden_effect` / `custom_tooltip` | presentation-only metadata, dropped before runtime | — |
| Static `modifier` (`_add`/`_mult` + category) | overlay `TransformOp::{Add,Multiply}` on a sub-field; **category → tree level / `SimThingKind`** | `overlay_prep.rs`, ancestor stack |
| `triggered_modifier { potential modifier }` | `Suspended`/`Transient` overlay, `ActivateOverlay` on threshold, `DissolveCondition` on exit | `overlay_lifecycle.rs` (v6) |
| `economic_category` hierarchy + generated keys | `DimensionRegistry` columns + reduction `OrderBand`s; `_mult` propagates to children = reduction sweep | `reduction.rs`, C-5/C-6 |
| `resources { produces upkeep cost category }` | Resource Flow arena: `IntrinsicFlow` / `AllocatedFlow` / `Balance` | `resource_flow_substrate.md` |
| `overlord_resources` / trade / subject diversion | cross-arena **coupling edge** with declared `CouplingDelay` | Resource Flow ADR §commit 3 |
| `value:` script value (base + math + modifier) | `EvalEML` formula tree (`ExactDeterministic`, ≤32 nodes) | `accumulator_op.wgsl`, C-8 |
| `complex_trigger_modifier` (bool→number) | `EvalEML` `SELECT`/threshold-count | C-8 |
| `@scripted_variable`, inline `@[ ]` | compile-time constant folding (spec layer) | — |
| Runtime variables (`set_variable`) | `Named` sub-field columns + overlays | `property.rs` |
| Capability tree (tradition/edict/tech) | one `Custom(...)` SimThing; progress = sub-fields; unlock = `Suspended` overlay; `possible` = threshold gate; `cost`/`upkeep` = flow drain | **`capability_tree_v1.md` (1:1)** |
| `on_action` periodic pulse (`on_monthly_pulse`) | **cadence tier** (EveryTick/4/10/60) + boundary handler | Mapping ADR §opt doctrine; boundary doctrine |
| `on_action` event hook | `Threshold` + `EmitEvent` | Pass 7 / delta log |
| Stars + hyperlanes | physical **spatial tree** (`design_v6` §2) + adjacency/coupling topology | `design_v6.md` §2 |
| Dense province / local field | **RegionCell** grid + `StructuredFieldStencilOp` (L1) | Mapping ADR L1 |
| `setup_scenario`, `solar_system_initializers` | `ScenarioSpec` + `AddChild` boundary requests / projection | `FirstSliceScenarioSpec` |
| Fog / stale intel / espionage / deception | **perception filter fields** (true→perceived write-boundary) | Mapping ADR §perception |
| `ai_will_do` / `ai_weight` | `EvalEML` pressure/urgency → `Threshold` crossing = commitment | **SEAD AI-as-SimThing** (Mapping ADR) |
| `ai_budget` (economic personality) | overlay-modifiable **allocator weight** columns | Resource Flow ADR §commit 4 |
| `diplomatic_stances` / personalities | authored `EvalEML` **weight profiles** (CPU selects, GPU computes) | economy→SEAD fixture |

The textbook's own conclusion — that ClauseScript's economy is *"an emergent
directed graph of category + modifier + scope + budget"* (§9.9) — describes, almost
exactly, SimThing's *overlay + reduction + arena + allocator* graph. The two models
are isomorphic at the level that matters; ClauseThing is the isomorphism made
explicit.

## 5. The tiered strategy

Tiering runs along **two axes**. We commit to both and reconcile them: a **domain
ladder** (entities → flows → mapping → AI) where each rung is a shippable vertical
slice, and within each rung a **fidelity ladder** (literal → conditional →
expression) controlling how much of the language's metaprogramming we admit.

Each tier is classified against the V7.7 gating policy. The pattern mirrors Phase M
exactly: the *first* slice of a tier is Tier-2 (new architecture / open question);
incremental fidelity within an accepted tier is Tier-1 fast-lane (one PR + one test
report + one status row), provided it stays generic, opt-in, CPU-oracle-parity-
backed, and reversible.

### Tier 0 — Parser + raw model (foundation)

- **Scope:** `jomini`-based lex/parse → tape → raw, typed, scope-resolved definition
  model. Mixed containers, headers, operators, comments, duplication-as-ordered-
  sequence. `[[param]]` / `$PARAM$` / `@[ ]` / `inline_script` expansion. Scope
  validation against `scopes.log`. JSON golden-file projection for tests.
- **Produces:** raw structs only. **No SimThing artifact yet.**
- **Gate:** **Tier-2** (new front-end architecture). After acceptance, parser
  feature additions are Tier-1.
- **Exit proof:** round-trip a corpus of authored `.txt` to JSON and back; reject
  malformed scope chains with good diagnostics.

### Tier 1 — Entities & overlays (the "definitions" core)

- **Scope:** blocks → SimThing templates; keyed scalars → properties / sub-fields;
  static `modifier` blocks → overlays (`Add`/`Multiply`/`Set`); `triggered_modifier`
  → `Suspended`/`Transient` overlay + threshold/dissolve; capability trees
  (traditions/edicts/tech) → the existing `capability_tree_v1` pattern verbatim;
  `possible`/`potential`/`allow` triggers → threshold gates.
- **Fidelity sub-ladder:**
  - **1a** literal modifiers + flat properties → overlays (`T1`).
  - **1b** `triggered_modifier` + `possible` → suspended overlays + threshold gates (`T1`).
  - **1c** capability-tree wiring (prereq DAG → threshold ordering; payload → activation) (`T1`).
- **Maps to:** `overlay.rs`, `overlay_lifecycle.rs`, `capability_tree_v1.md`,
  `ThresholdRegistration`.
- **Gate:** first slice **Tier-2** (establishes the entity-hydration contract); 1a–1c
  thereafter **Tier-1**.
- **Honest constraint (the biggest practical gap):** the **modifier `category` →
  tree-level mapping** has no automatic meaning in SimThing and must be resolved
  explicitly (a `category → (SimThingKind, tree depth, recalc cadence)` table). To
  keep this from being an ergonomic regression versus Paradox's implicit
  planet/country/pop granularity, the front-end ships **conventional defaults + sugar**,
  not a bare requirement: a small built-in default table maps the common
  `country`/`planet`/`pop`-style category names to sensible kinds/depths, a single
  `category_map { ... }` authoring block overrides per project, and an unmapped
  category is a hard admission error with a suggested mapping — never a silent
  guess. We do **not** reverse-engineer Stellaris category semantics; the designer
  confirms or overrides the defaults.

### Tier 2 — Flows & economy

- **Scope:** `resources { produces upkeep cost }` → Resource Flow arenas
  (`IntrinsicFlow`/`AllocatedFlow`/`Balance`); `economic_category` parent hierarchy →
  registry columns + reduction `OrderBand`s + arena descriptors with declared caps;
  `value:` script values → `EvalEML` (`ExactDeterministic`, ≤32 nodes); `@vars` +
  `@[ ]` → constant folding; **discrete** adoption costs/upkeep → `ResourceEconomySpec`
  discrete banking; **continuous** flow → E-11 hierarchical allocation (opt-in,
  default-off); `overlord_resources`/trade → coupling edges with `CouplingDelay`.
- **Fidelity sub-ladder:**
  - **2a** literal `produces`/`upkeep` → `IntrinsicFlow` registrations (`T1`).
  - **2b** `trigger`-gated sub-blocks → `EvalEML` `SELECT` / threshold gate (`T1`).
  - **2c** `value:` amounts + economic-category inheritance → reduction OrderBands (`T1`).
  - **2d** coupling (`overlord_resources`/trade) → cross-arena edges (`T2` — touches cycle/delay admission).
- **Maps to:** `resource_flow_substrate.md` (all four commitments), `accumulator_op_v2_production_plan.md` (E-7…E-11), `adr_accumulator_op_v2.md`.
- **Gate:** first slice + 2d **Tier-2**; 2a–2c **Tier-1**.
- **Honest constraints:** conservation is **approximate-deterministic** for
  continuous flow (O(ε·n), residual into `Balance`) — exactly the ADR's contract;
  hard-currency exactness uses the discrete path. EML must stay in
  `ExactDeterministic`; richer classes are per-PR opt-in only.

### Tier 3 — Mapping & space

- **Scope:** stars/systems → spatial tree nodes; hyperlanes → adjacency / coupling
  topology; `setup_scenario` → `ScenarioSpec`; `solar_system_initializers` →
  `AddChild`/projection; **dense local fields** (threat/suppression/supply/
  contamination) → RegionCell + `StructuredFieldStencilOp` (L1) → `SlotRange` Sum
  reduction (L2) → parent `field_urgency` `EvalEML` (L3); perception/fog → perception
  filter fields with the true→perceived write-boundary; periodic `on_action` →
  cadence tiers.
- **Fidelity sub-ladder:**
  - **3a** static topology (systems + hyperlanes) → spatial tree + adjacency (`T1`).
  - **3b** single-grid dense field → first-slice mapping runtime (the **landed**
    `SparseRegionFieldV1` path; ClauseScript just authors the `RegionFieldSpec`) (`T1`).
  - **3c** perception filter fields (`T2` — admission contract).
  - **3d** atlas / multi-theater (`T2` — gated, atlas still Provisional/unimplemented).
- **Maps to:** `adr/mapping_sparse_regioncell.md`, `design_v7_7.md`, the landed
  `FirstSliceScenarioSpec` / `RegionFieldSpec` / `MappingExecutionProfile`.
- **Gate:** 3a/3b **Tier-1** (authoring over accepted runtime, default-off); 3c/3d **Tier-2/deferred** per the standing prohibition list.
- **Honest constraint:** no dense lateral long-horizon diffusion as strategic
  awareness — the load-bearing negative result holds; ClauseScript authoring cannot
  override the three-layer model. `MappingExecutionProfile` default stays `Disabled`.

### Tier 4 — AI commitments & governance

- **Scope:** `ai_will_do`/`ai_weight` → `EvalEML` pressure/urgency formula → `Threshold`
  + `EmitEvent` = commitment (**AI-as-SimThing, no CPU planner**); `ai_budget` →
  overlay-modifiable allocator weight columns; `diplomatic_stances`/personalities →
  authored EML weight profiles (the CPU may *select* a profile, as in the accepted
  economy→SEAD fixture, but never computes urgency or emits the commitment).
- **Fidelity sub-ladder:**
  - **4a** `ai_weight` → EML urgency → threshold commitment (`T1`, over accepted SEAD path).
  - **4b** `ai_budget` → allocator weight overlays (`T1`).
  - **4c** velocity/trajectory pressures → explicit previous-value column pattern (`T2`).
- **Maps to:** Mapping ADR §AI-as-SimThing, SEAD probes, Resource Flow §commit 4.
- **Gate:** 4a/4b **Tier-1** over the accepted substrate; 4c **Tier-2** (explicit-column contract).
- **Honest constraint:** EML has **no previous-buffer read** — trajectory needs an
  explicit previous-value column + copy band (~14.3% overhead). No CPU map planner,
  ever; `ai_will_do` is data the GPU reads, not a CPU decision loop.

### Tier reconciliation

The domain ladder is a **dependency order**: T1 entities are the substrate T2 flows
attach to; T2 economic categories are the columns T3 mapping fields and T4 AI weights
read; T4 commitments fire over T2/T3 outputs. A vertical product slice picks one rung
of each as needed — exactly how the landed Phase M economy→SEAD fixture already spans
T2 (discrete economy) → T4 (commitment) without a production bridge.

## 6. Worked micro-examples (the mapping made concrete)

**A tradition (T1).** ClauseScript:

```script
tr_adaptability_recycling = {
    possible = { has_tradition = tr_adaptability_adopt }
    modifier = { planet_structures_volatile_motes_upkeep_mult = -0.15 }
    triggered_modifier {
        potential = { is_wilderness_empire = no }
        pop_housing_usage_mult = -0.10
    }
    ai_weight = { factor = 10000 }
}
```

→ on the owner's `Custom("tradition_tree")` SimThing: a progress sub-field gated by a
threshold compiled from `has_tradition = tr_adaptability_adopt`; a `Suspended` overlay
carrying `Multiply(-0.15)` on the `volatile_motes::upkeep` column, flipped to
`Permanent` by `ActivateOverlay` when the prereq threshold fires; a second overlay
that is `Suspended` until the `is_wilderness_empire == no` threshold holds and
`Transient`/dissolved when it fails; `ai_weight` → an `EvalEML` term feeding the
adoption-pressure column. (`capability_tree_v1.md` is the exact existing pattern.)

**A producer job (T2).** ClauseScript:

```script
resources = {
    category = planet_technician
    produces = { energy = 6 }
    produces { trigger = { owner = { is_robot_empire = yes } } energy = 2 }
}
```

→ an `IntrinsicFlow` registration into the `planet_technician → energy` arena column
(base 6), plus a second contribution gated by an `EvalEML SELECT` compiled from the
`is_robot_empire` trigger (read as a `Named` flag column). The `category` resolves to
the arena/column range; `_mult` modifiers authored elsewhere (T1 overlays) propagate
to it through the reduction OrderBand — no enumeration of jobs required, exactly as
the economic-category engine intends.

**An AI commitment (T4).** `ai_will_do { weight = { base 1; modifier { factor 5
is_at_war = yes } } }` → an `EvalEML` urgency formula over a pressure column; when it
crosses an authored `Threshold`, `EmitEvent` fires the commitment. The AI is a
SimThing: float columns in, threshold crossing out, designer EML in the middle.

---

## 7. Constitutional guardrails (binding on any implementation)

These are restatements of existing invariants applied to the front-end; none is new
enforcement, and none is relaxed.

1. **`simthing-sim` never sees ClauseScript.** No scope, modifier, category,
   `on_action`, `resources`, `value:`, or "tradition" concept crosses into the
   simulation crate. All compilation is in `clausething` / `simthing-spec` /
   `simthing-driver`. (Mirrors the Resource Flow `ArenaRegistry` firewall and the
   Mapping `simthing-sim` map-free rule.)
2. **No semantic WGSL, no new primitive, no new `AccumulatorRole`.** ClauseScript
   compiles onto the *existing* overlay / `AccumulatorOp` / `EvalEML` /
   `StructuredFieldStencilOp` / `Threshold` substrate. If a construct cannot be
   expressed on existing primitives, it is rejected at admission, not given a kernel.
3. **Opt-in, default-off.** Authoring in ClauseScript changes no defaults;
   `MappingExecutionProfile` stays `Disabled`, Resource Flow stays opt-in. Presence of
   a script is structure; execution requires explicit profile/scenario opt-in.
4. **CPU-oracle bit-exact parity (I8).** Every compiled `EvalEML` formula and every
   overlay op must match the CPU oracle to the float bit. Clausewitz math semantics
   we *do* model (mult-is-additive-in-effect stacking, clamps, `percentage = yes` as
   tooltip-only) must be modeled exactly or rejected.
5. **Determinism / replay-safety.** `random_list`, `random`, and any RNG construct
   compile to a **seeded deterministic stream** (replay bit-exact) or are **rejected
   at admission**. Non-deterministic authoring never reaches the runtime.
6. **Admission is the firewall, runtime is the last line.** `simthing-spec` rejects
   unsafe authoring (unbounded fanout, all-`Algebraic` coupling cycles, out-of-class
   EML, bad scope transitions, perceived→true writes) at import; the runtime still
   clamps/validates unconditionally.
7. **Gating discipline.** Tier-1 fast-lane only for within-accepted-design, generic,
   opt-in, parity-backed, reversible feature additions; everything touching a binding
   invariant, a default, new architecture, or an open question is Tier-2. **The
   front-end's introduction is Tier-2.**

---

## 8. Current limits & sequencing hard problems

The textbook is candid that ClauseScript is *"recklessly flexible."* These are the
real sequencing challenges — things that do not translate cleanly *yet*, with notes
on how they eventually close:

- **The Stellaris standard library is built incrementally, not declared out of scope.**
  The grammar is the foundation; the standard vocabulary of named effects (`set_owner`,
  `create_fleet`, …), triggers, and the 3.8 MB of generated modifier keys are real
  work to map, but the aspiration is that they get mapped. Each effect/trigger that
  matters gets a SimThing compilation target (column op, overlay, BoundaryRequest,
  EmitEvent) as the tiers advance. An unknown effect/trigger is a hard admission error
  *with a diagnostic and a suggested path* — not a permanent "unsupported," but a
  signal of what to build next. The gap between "grammar accepted" and "full standard
  library covered" is the long tail of the project.
- **Modifier category → simulation level requires an explicit authored table.**
  Mitigated by built-in defaults + a `category_map` override + hard errors on unmapped
  categories (§5 Tier 1), but the table is still real authoring work and the most
  likely source of early friction. Treat the default table's quality as a first-class
  deliverable, not an afterthought.
- **Recalculation model differs — *probably* a simplification, but unmeasured.**
  ClauseScript caches and invalidates modifiers on events; SimThing re-evaluates every
  column every tick on GPU. This removes ClauseScript's invalidation complexity, but
  "cheap country-level modifier" cost intuitions do not carry over — everything is a
  column, and frequency mismatches are handled by cadence tiers, not lazy evaluation.
  The claim that this is a net simplification is an **assumption that must be
  stress-tested early** (CT-1b, §9): a corpus with many `triggered_modifier` blocks →
  many `Suspended`/`Threshold` registrations could move column/threshold counts in
  ways that matter. Measure before relying on it.
- **Dynamic scope chains (`from`, event context) are an open design question, not a
  free mapping.** `root`/`from` context passing compiles to `EmitEvent` payloads +
  boundary handlers; chains that reference state not held in a column cannot be
  GPU-resident and are rejected or bounded to the CPU boundary (never a per-tick CPU
  planner). **But the current event substrate may not carry the rich context Paradox
  designers expect**, so extending the `EmitEvent` payload is a likely **Tier-2
  substrate change that must be scoped and accepted *before* any tier leans on
  `from`/`root` chaining.** T1a–T1c are deliberately chosen to need only same-scope
  triggers so the front-end can land without blocking on this.
- **`complex_trigger_modifier` and arbitrary bool→number extraction** only compile
  when the underlying trigger reads a column; otherwise rejected.
- **Duplication / mod load-order semantics** are load-bearing and must be pinned by
  explicit policy at compile time. v1 ships the documented default policy in §3
  (last-wins scalars / collection for list-registry keys / explicit `@override`
  marker); cross-unit mod merging is deferred (jomini gives the mechanism, the spec
  owns the policy). Surprising-merge behavior is a real designer-facing risk — the
  policy must be in the authoring docs, not just the compiler.
- **Binary save format, localization rendering, and presentation hooks** are out of
  scope (§10).
- **Long-range gradient quality and AI *decision* quality** remain gameplay-
  evaluation questions, exactly as the Mapping ADR states; ClauseThing establishes an
  authoring path and constitutional safety, not balance.

## 9. Proposed first slice & PR ladder (for gating, not yet authorized)

Following the Phase-M discipline — one accepted vertical proof before breadth:

1. **CT-0 (Tier-2 gate):** `simthing-clausewitz` crate skeleton; `jomini` parse →
   raw model → JSON golden tests; scope validation against `scopes.log`. No SimThing
   emission. *Exit:* round-trip corpus + diagnostics.
2. **CT-1a (Tier-2 first entity slice, then Tier-1):** literal `modifier` blocks +
   flat properties on a single SimThing template → overlays, compiled through the
   *existing* `simthing-spec` install path; CPU-oracle parity on the resulting
   overlay application. *Exit:* a ClauseScript-authored entity produces a tree
   bit-identical to the RON-authored equivalent.
3. **CT-1b (recalc stress test — do before breadth):** compile a corpus with a large
   number of `triggered_modifier` blocks and measure the resulting `Suspended`/
   `Threshold`/column counts and tick cost against an equivalent RON baseline. This
   validates (or refutes) the "every-tick re-evaluation is a net simplification"
   assumption from §8 before later tiers depend on it.
4. **CT-1c:** one capability tree (a small tradition set) → `capability_tree_v1`
   pattern, prereq DAG → threshold ordering, payload activation. *This is the first
   real "designer writes Clausewitz, SimThing runs it" proof.*
5. **CT-2a/2c:** a `resources`/`economic_category` micro-economy → Resource Flow
   arena (opt-in, default-off), reusing the discrete `ResourceEconomySpec` path for
   costs. *Exit:* the existing Daily Economy Fixture, but authored in ClauseScript.
6. **CT-3b + CT-4a (vertical proof):** a ClauseScript-authored `RegionFieldSpec` +
   `ai_will_do` → the **already-accepted** GPU-resident first-slice SEAD path
   (field → reduction → `field_urgency` EML → threshold commitment), default-off. This
   is the headline proof: *the entire accepted Phase-M vertical slice, authored in
   Clausewitz, with `simthing-sim` still map-free and ClauseScript-blind.*

Each PR: one crate change + one test report + one status row, per the gating policy.
Anything touching coupling-cycle admission (2d), perception (3c), atlas (3d), or
explicit-velocity columns (4c) stays Tier-2.

## 10. Permanent exclusions & runtime constraints

These are the things that are genuinely out of scope — not sequencing gaps, but
architectural boundaries that hold regardless of how far ClauseScript coverage
advances.

**Permanent exclusions (will never be in scope):**
- **Binary save-format reading.** `jomini` can do it; ClauseThing will not. Save
  games are engine state, not authoring. This boundary is load-bearing.
- **Presentation-only constructs.** `custom_tooltip`, `defined_text`, localization
  keys, portrait/name lists, bracket localisations — dropped before runtime. SimThing
  has no display layer to route them to.
- **Stellaris engine-specific behavior that has no SimThing equivalent.** Some effects
  and triggers are pure Stellaris engine calls with no meaningful compilation target
  (e.g. galaxy rendering, save/load hooks, UI animations). These are rejected with a
  diagnostic. The test for "no equivalent": if there is no column, overlay,
  BoundaryRequest, EmitEvent, or threshold that captures the semantics, it stays out.

**Runtime constraints (how ClauseScript compiles, not how much we admit):**
- **No semantic WGSL, no new primitive, no new `AccumulatorRole`.** ClauseScript
  compiles onto *existing* substrate. Constructs that require a new primitive require
  that primitive to be designed and accepted first — then the ClauseScript mapping
  follows. This is sequencing, not exclusion.
- **No CPU AI planner or semantic sidecar.** `ai_will_do` is data the GPU reads.
  Commitments are threshold crossings. This is architectural, not a limit on
  expressiveness.
- **No `simthing-sim` awareness.** The simulation crate never sees ClauseScript
  concepts. All compilation terminates at the spec/driver layer.
- **No relaxation of `invariants.md`.** Every change to a binding invariant is Tier-2
  regardless of whether it was motivated by a ClauseScript mapping need.
- **Admitting a new construct is a gated decision.** Tier-1 if within accepted design
  and generic; Tier-2 otherwise. Expansion is expected and welcome — it just goes
  through the gate.

**RON stays valid and co-equal.** ClauseScript is not a replacement — it is a
parallel first-class surface. Designers choose the language that fits their
background and workflow. Both compile to the same `simthing-spec` contract.

## 11. Read order for agents picking this up

1. `design_v7_7.md` §5 — gating governance (which lane is your slice).
2. `invariants.md` — binding constraints (the firewall is here).
3. `adr/resource_flow_substrate.md` + `adr_accumulator_op_v2.md` — the economic substrate ClauseScript flows compile onto.
4. `adr/mapping_sparse_regioncell.md` + `design_v7_7.md` §2–3 — the mapping/SEAD substrate ClauseScript fields and AI compile onto.
5. `capability_tree_v1.md` — the exact pattern ClauseScript traditions/edicts/tech reuse.
6. This document §4 (correspondence) and §5 (tiers).
7. `C:\Users\mvorm\ClauseThing.md` + `Clauser/Paradox/script_documentation/*.log` — the language ground truth, before changing any compile mapping.
8. `Clauser/jomini/README.md` + `src/` — the parser the front-end is built on.

---

*ClauseThing is the aspiration that ClauseScript becomes as natural a way to author
SimThing as RON — a full first-class surface, not a subset. The tiered ladder is a
sequencing discipline, not a ceiling. The runtime stays flat, deterministic,
GPU-resident, replayable, and semantic-free — and never learns that it is, in part,
speaking Clausewitz.*

## 12. Promotion path

This document currently lives in `workshop/` as a strategy proposal. If the direction
receives real interest, the natural next step is promotion to a proper ADR
(`adr/clausething_frontend.md`) or a `design_v7_8` companion note after the Tier-2
design review + acceptance pass. The test for readiness: CT-0 (parser + raw model)
is accepted and CT-1a (first bit-identical entity) is green. At that point the
proposal is no longer speculative and deserves a stable home in the ADR index.
